Title: How to Choose an Agent for Attacking and Defending in Valorant

Introduction: In Valorant, team composition plays a pivotal role in both attack and defense phases. Every agent is tailored for a particular playstyle and strategic approach, making it crucial to select agents that can adapt to both attacking and defending. The selection process must take into account not just the abilities of an agent but how those abilities can synergize with the rest of the team in both offensive and defensive setups.

Key Factors in Agent Selection
When choosing an agent, it is important to understand a few overarching factors:

Playstyle Compatibility: Your personal playstyle should influence your choice of agent. Are you aggressive or prefer to hold angles and play defensively? Some agents thrive on aggressive play, while others excel in tactical defense.
Role Fit: Each agent belongs to one of four primary roles: Duelist, Initiator, Controller, and Sentinel. Each role has its unique importance in either the attack or defense phase.
Map Considerations: Different maps in Valorant favor different agents and abilities. Knowing how your chosen agent can maximize map-specific advantages is key.
Team Synergy: Valorant is a team-based game, so no matter how strong an individual agent is, they need to work well with the team composition. Ensure that your agent fills gaps in the team or enhances the overall team strategy.
Choosing an Agent for Attacking
On the attacking side, the primary goal is to control space, break through enemy defenses, and plant the spike. Agents that can initiate engagements, disrupt enemy lines, or cover large areas of the map tend to perform well. Here’s a breakdown of roles that excel in attack and what to look for:

1. Duelists
Duelists are typically the most aggressive agents, designed to take fights and create openings for the team. Their abilities help them win one-on-one duels and push through enemy defenses.

Phoenix: His ability to flash enemies with curveball, regenerate health using his Blaze or Hot Hands, and get a second chance with his ultimate "Run it Back" makes Phoenix a great pick for aggressively breaking through choke points.
Jett: Jett’s mobility with her Dash and Updraft allows her to quickly take space on the map, and her smokes (Cloudburst) are handy for short-term cover. She’s effective at taking high-risk, high-reward duels and creating confusion among enemies.
Reyna: Reyna excels in isolated engagements. Her ability to heal or become invulnerable after getting a kill (Devour and Dismiss) helps her chain eliminations during aggressive pushes.
2. Initiators
Initiators create opportunities for the team by setting up fights and enabling entry onto bomb sites with their abilities. They are crucial for gathering information and disrupting enemy defenses.

Sova: Sova’s Recon Bolt and Owl Drone are essential for gathering intel about enemy positioning, helping the team plan their attack routes. His Shock Darts and ultimate can also help flush out enemies from hiding spots.
Skye: Skye’s Guiding Light (flashbird) and Trailblazer (tiger) are ideal for scouting and blinding enemies before a push. Her healing ability also ensures that her team stays healthy after skirmishes.
KAY/O: His suppression ability is invaluable during attacks. KAY/O can disable enemy abilities, especially Sentinels, making it easier for the team to enter sites without worrying about traps or defensive utilities.
3. Controllers
Controllers are experts in manipulating the battlefield, typically using smoke and zone control to help their team gain an advantage during site takes.

Brimstone: His ability to place multiple smokes at once, combined with his Molotov (Incendiary) for post-plant scenarios, makes him an excellent attacker. His ultimate, Orbital Strike, is deadly for denying defuse attempts.
Omen: Omen’s long-lasting smokes, teleport (Shrouded Step), and paranoia (flash) allow him to execute sneaky plays. His ultimate is useful for scouting or creating chaos during an attack.
4. Sentinels (in Attack)
Though Sentinels are typically defense-oriented, some of their utilities can be used to gain map control or cover flanks during an attack.

Sage: Sage can block off important sightlines or choke points with her Barrier Orb, allowing her team to safely plant the spike. She can also heal teammates after engagements, keeping them ready for the next round.
Killjoy: Her Nanoswarms can be used post-plant to deny defuse attempts, while her turret can cover flanks, ensuring that her team can focus on the attack without worrying about being surprised from behind.
Choosing an Agent for Defending
Defending is all about holding angles, gathering intel, and slowing down or stopping the attacking team. Agents with crowd control abilities, information-gathering tools, or utilities that block or slow enemies are ideal for defense.

1. Sentinels
Sentinels are defensive experts, excelling at holding sites and locking down areas of the map. They often provide valuable utility to slow down attackers or gather intel on their movements.

Killjoy: Killjoy’s turrets and Alarmbot are excellent for gathering information and delaying pushes. Her Nanoswarm grenades can lock down plant spots or choke points, making her a menace in post-plant scenarios.
Sage: Sage’s ability to slow down attackers with her Slow Orb and heal teammates mid-fight makes her a key defensive player. Her Barrier Orb can block crucial chokepoints or fortify weak points in the defense.
2. Controllers (in Defense)
Controllers are also crucial for the defensive phase, providing smoke cover and zoning utilities to deny attackers access to critical areas.

Astra: Astra’s global smokes and ability to place stars across the map make her a versatile defender. Her Gravity Well and Nova Pulse abilities are perfect for disrupting aggressive pushes and forcing enemies into unfavorable positions.
Viper: On defense, Viper’s Toxic Screen and Poison Cloud can block entry points, making it difficult for attackers to enter a site without taking damage. Her Ultimate, Viper’s Pit, is a powerful tool for retaking or securing a bomb site.
3. Initiators (in Defense)
Initiators also play a critical role in defense, providing information or disrupting attacking pushes. Though their role is typically more offensive, they can be incredibly valuable for stalling or countering aggressive attackers.

Breach: Breach’s wide-area flashes, stuns, and aftershocks are incredibly disruptive for attackers. He can delay pushes and make it harder for attackers to take control of critical areas.
Sova: His Recon Bolt and Owl Drone can provide critical information about the positioning of attackers. Sova can scout areas and ensure that defenders are not taken by surprise.
4. Duelists (in Defense)
Though Duelists are designed for aggressive play, they can also excel in defense if used strategically.

Jett: Jett’s mobility allows her to take early picks on attackers and quickly reposition to a safer location. She can hold aggressive angles and escape easily if pressured.
Raze: Raze’s explosive utility can delay attackers and force them to reposition. Her Boom Bot and grenades are great for zoning, while her ultimate, Showstopper, can easily shut down a push.
Conclusion: Adapting to Both Phases
Choosing an agent requires flexibility. Some agents excel in both attack and defense, while others might specialize in one phase. Ultimately, understanding your role, the team’s composition, and the map is key. For example, a Killjoy can dominate the defense phase with her traps and turrets, but during an attack, she can be equally effective with post-plant utilities like Nanoswarm.

Communication with your team is also critical. If your team lacks a strong defender or attacker, consider filling that gap with an agent suited to the task. It’s essential to think not just of individual performance but of how the entire composition works together, whether you are attacking or defending.
