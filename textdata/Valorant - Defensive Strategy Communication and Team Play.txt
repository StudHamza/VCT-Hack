Communication and Team Play

Solid communication is the backbone of a strong defense.

Callouts: Make sure to communicate key pieces of information, such as enemy positions, abilities used, and how many attackers are spotted. For example, if you hear the attackers breaking through mid, call it out so the team can adjust their rotations.

Playing Around the Spike: Once the attackers have planted the spike, the dynamic shifts. On defense, it’s vital to understand when to engage in a retake or save your weapons for the next round. In a 1v4, saving your weapons might be more beneficial than attempting a retake.

Retakes: Defenders need to work together to retake a site once the spike is planted. This requires coordinated use of utility and abilities. For instance, using a Breach’s fault line to stun enemies in key locations while Jett dashes in for the kill can be a powerful combination.
