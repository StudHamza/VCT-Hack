Entry and Pushing Strategies

An effective push begins with strong team coordination. Pushing as a cohesive unit rather than as individuals is critical to ensuring that trades are made and sites are taken effectively.

Executing the Push: When pushing a site, Duelists or Initiators should lead the charge, using their abilities to clear angles and create space. Flashes, smokes, and dashes should be timed carefully so that enemies have no time to respond. For example, Jett can dash in while an Initiator like Breach or Skye uses a flashbang to disorient defenders.

Clearing Corners and Angles: When pushing into a site, it’s essential to methodically clear every angle and corner. Use utility like Sova’s Recon Bolt or Skye’s Trailblazer to check common camping spots. If there’s no utility available, use pre-aim and teamwork to clear potential threats.

Trading Kills: One of the most important principles of a good offensive push is trading kills. If your entry-fragger dies, another teammate should immediately follow up with the elimination of the defender. Pushing in a tight formation ensures that defenders can't easily pick off isolated players, and you can overwhelm a site.

Splitting and Pinching: A good offensive team will often use split pushes to divide defender resources. For example, two players might push from A Long, while the rest of the team comes in from A Short, creating a pinch that overwhelms the defenders. This strategy forces defenders to hold multiple angles simultaneously, making them vulnerable to being outflanked.
