Selecting Duelists for Defense

Although Duelists are primarily known for their offensive capabilities, they can still be valuable on defense, especially when holding aggressive angles or taking early map control. Defensive Duelists play a more reserved role compared to their offensive counterparts, but they can still secure critical frags, disrupt attackers, and maintain control of key areas.

Key Attributes of Defensive Duelists:
Aggressive Angle Holding: Defensive Duelists often hold aggressive angles at choke points to challenge attackers early in the round. Players with strong mechanical skills who can consistently win these fights are valuable in this role, as they can disrupt the attackersâ€™ plans by securing early picks.

Rotational Flexibility: Duelists on defense need to be flexible, able to rotate quickly between sites and adapt to changing situations. Their speed and ability to reposition effectively allow them to support teammates during fast site executions or post-plant retakes.

Impact Frags: A defensive Duelist must be able to secure impact frags when needed, particularly in clutch situations. Duelists who can step up and win critical 1v1s or take down multiple opponents during a site push are essential in turning the tide of defensive rounds.
