Creating a Balanced Offensive Team

A well-rounded offensive team typically includes at least one Duelist, one Initiator, one Controller, and potentially a Sentinel for flank watch or post-plant security. Here's a possible team composition based on the players mentioned above:

Duelist: Mel (Cloud9 White) or Katsumi (Cloud9 White)
Initiator: alexis (Cloud9 White)
Controller: Chobo (Gen.G Black)
Sentinel: Flowerful (Shopify Rebellion GC)
This composition provides a balanced approach to offense, with strong fragging potential, effective utility usage, and good post-plant control.
