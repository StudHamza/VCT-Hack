Map Awareness and Control

One of the most crucial components of a strong offense is map awareness. Offensive teams must understand how to take control of critical areas of the map, which can provide strategic advantages in securing bomb sites and defeating defenders.

Key Areas and Choke Points: Each map in Valorant has specific areas and choke points that attackers will need to push through to reach bomb sites. For example, on Ascent, mid-control is key for attackers, while on Bind, teleporters offer flexibility in rotations between sites. Being able to take control of these crucial areas can force defenders to play passively or rotate prematurely.

Map Knowledge: Understand the layout of the map, including common defender positions and angles where defenders might hold. Being aware of the most common defender spots will allow you to pre-aim and check these corners, reducing the chances of getting caught off guard. Maps like Haven have three bomb sites, making it essential to play dynamically, using fakes and rotations to spread the defending team thin.

Sound Cues and Rotation Control: Use sound strategically. Walk to avoid giving away your position, especially when approaching a choke point. However, in some cases, you can fake rotations by running and creating noise to make the enemy team think you're heading toward a different site. This can lead to misinformation, forcing defenders to rotate incorrectly.
