Adapting Mid-Game

Defense in Valorant is rarely static. Attackers will constantly change their strategies, and as defenders, you must adapt.

Counter-Stratting: Pay attention to patterns. If the enemy team keeps pushing the same site, anticipate it and stack more defenders in that area. Adjust the setup, moving utility like Killjoy’s turret or Cypher’s camera, to catch them off-guard.

Baiting and Repositioning: If the attackers are targeting specific areas repeatedly, try setting up a bait play. For example, have one player pretend to hold an angle, only to fall back into a crossfire with another teammate.

Changing Playstyles: A static defense can become predictable. Midway through the match, consider changing your playstyle. Play more aggressively in a round or two, pushing attackers when they least expect it. Then fall back to passive holding in later rounds. The unpredictability will force the attackers to rethink their approach.
