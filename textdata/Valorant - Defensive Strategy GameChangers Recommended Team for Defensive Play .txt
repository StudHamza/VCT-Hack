Team Composition for Defensive Play

When forming a defensive team, it is important to create a balanced composition that provides strong map control, utility, and adaptability. A typical defensive setup might consist of:

1 Sentinel (Killjoy, Cypher) for locking down sites and watching flanks.
1 Controller (Astra, Omen) for smoke placement and site control.
1 Initiator (Sova, Skye) for gathering information and disrupting pushes.
1 Duelist (Jett, Raze) for aggressive angle holding and securing early picks.
Flex Player: A player who can switch between roles as needed, offering flexibility in either an offensive or defensive setup.
