Adapting and Learning from Mistakes

Offensive strategies should always be adaptable. Defenders will change their setups throughout the game, so attackers must also shift their approach.

Anticipating Rotations and Adaptations: If the enemy team starts stacking a particular site, you can take advantage of their overcommitment by applying pressure elsewhere. Learning how the defenders are playing and adjusting your strategies accordingly can keep them off-balance.

Learning from Failures: Itâ€™s crucial to analyze rounds where your attack failed. Did your team use abilities too early? Did you push in without clearing critical angles? Were your rotations too slow? By reflecting on what went wrong, you can adjust your tactics and improve in future rounds.
