Choosing an Agent for Defending

Defending is all about holding angles, gathering intel, and slowing down or stopping the attacking team. Agents with crowd control abilities, information-gathering tools, or utilities that block or slow enemies are ideal for defense.

1. Sentinels
Sentinels are defensive experts, excelling at holding sites and locking down areas of the map. They often provide valuable utility to slow down attackers or gather intel on their movements.

Killjoy: Killjoy’s turrets and Alarmbot are excellent for gathering information and delaying pushes. Her Nanoswarm grenades can lock down plant spots or choke points, making her a menace in post-plant scenarios.
Sage: Sage’s ability to slow down attackers with her Slow Orb and heal teammates mid-fight makes her a key defensive player. Her Barrier Orb can block crucial chokepoints or fortify weak points in the defense.
2. Controllers (in Defense)
Controllers are also crucial for the defensive phase, providing smoke cover and zoning utilities to deny attackers access to critical areas.

Astra: Astra’s global smokes and ability to place stars across the map make her a versatile defender. Her Gravity Well and Nova Pulse abilities are perfect for disrupting aggressive pushes and forcing enemies into unfavorable positions.
Viper: On defense, Viper’s Toxic Screen and Poison Cloud can block entry points, making it difficult for attackers to enter a site without taking damage. Her Ultimate, Viper’s Pit, is a powerful tool for retaking or securing a bomb site.
3. Initiators (in Defense)
Initiators also play a critical role in defense, providing information or disrupting attacking pushes. Though their role is typically more offensive, they can be incredibly valuable for stalling or countering aggressive attackers.

Breach: Breach’s wide-area flashes, stuns, and aftershocks are incredibly disruptive for attackers. He can delay pushes and make it harder for attackers to take control of critical areas.
Sova: His Recon Bolt and Owl Drone can provide critical information about the positioning of attackers. Sova can scout areas and ensure that defenders are not taken by surprise.
4. Duelists (in Defense)
Though Duelists are designed for aggressive play, they can also excel in defense if used strategically.

Jett: Jett’s mobility allows her to take early picks on attackers and quickly reposition to a safer location. She can hold aggressive angles and escape easily if pressured.
Raze: Raze’s explosive utility can delay attackers and force them to reposition. Her Boom Bot and grenades are great for zoning, while her ultimate, Showstopper, can easily shut down a push.
