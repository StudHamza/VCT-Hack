Economy Management

The economy plays a significant role in both offensive and defensive strategies in Valorant.

Eco Rounds: During rounds where your team is low on funds, prioritize buying utility over weapons. Utility, such as Cypher’s tripwires or Brimstone’s smokes, can still be used effectively even if you are using cheaper weapons like pistols.

Bonus Rounds: After winning a pistol round, the second round is crucial. Opt for light armor and SMGs to maintain the economic advantage. After winning the bonus round, you’ll be in a better position to fully buy during future rounds, giving you a continued advantage on defense.

Force Buys: If your team is forced to buy due to a lost round, make sure everyone agrees on the purchase. It’s better for the whole team to force-buy together than have one or two players
