Selecting Initiators for Offense
Initiators are key in providing information and setting up the Duelists for success. They ensure that the team is well-informed about enemy positions before committing to a push and use their utility to force defenders out of advantageous positions. In the VCT Game Changers scene, several players stand out for their exceptional Initiator gameplay.
