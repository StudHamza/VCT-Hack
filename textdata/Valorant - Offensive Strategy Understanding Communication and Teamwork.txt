Communication and Teamwork

Effective communication is one of the most important aspects of a good offensive strategy. Without clear and consistent communication, even the best plans can fall apart.

Callouts: Use accurate callouts to provide your teammates with valuable information. If you spot a defender or hear a rotation, relay that information to the rest of the team immediately. Keep callouts concise and to the point, and avoid overloading your team with unnecessary details.

Coordinate with Teammates: Successful pushes require timing. Use voice communication to sync your team’s abilities and movements. For instance, when an Initiator flashes, the Duelist should push in immediately to take advantage of the disoriented defenders. If you’re rotating, make sure everyone is on the same page before switching directions.

Post-Plant Communication: After the spike is planted, communication becomes even more important. Call out when defenders are spotted on the retake and communicate any utility you still have. For example, if your Brimstone still has a Molotov or Incendiary, let the team know to delay the spike defuse.
