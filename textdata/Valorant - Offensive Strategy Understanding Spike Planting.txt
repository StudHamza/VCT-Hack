Spike Planting

Securing the spike plant is the primary goal for attackers in Valorant. Proper spike placement and post-plant positioning can drastically improve your chances of winning the round.

Safe Planting: Always plant the spike in a safe location, preferably behind cover or with teammates holding key angles. Controllers or Sentinels can use their utility to block off defenders while the spike is being planted.

Post-Plant Positioning: Once the spike is planted, reposition to defend the spike rather than overextend for more kills. Post-plant positions should cover common retake routes that defenders will use. For example, on B Site of Ascent, players can hold from Main, Market, and Lane to cover all possible angles of approach from the defenders.

Planting for a Specific Position: Sometimes the spike is planted in an area that is easier to defend from certain positions. For instance, planting the spike on A Site of Haven in a spot visible from Long or Short allows players to hold from those locations without having to be on-site.
