Selecting Controllers for Defense

Controllers are crucial in maintaining defensive setups, using their abilities to block off sightlines, control choke points, and slow down the attackers’ advances. A strong Controller player can single-handedly shift the tide of a round by placing well-timed smokes or utility that deny critical space to the attackers. In defense, Controllers provide flexibility and play an essential role in rotating between sites or retaking areas after losing control.

Key Attributes of Defensive Controllers:
Area Control: Defensive Controllers are experts at blocking enemy sightlines and controlling space with smokes, walls, and other abilities. A well-placed smoke can block the attackers’ vision and force them to rethink their approach, buying valuable time for the defense to rotate or regroup.

Post-Plant Utility: In post-plant situations, Controllers can use their abilities to stall the enemy’s defuse attempts or create favorable conditions for the defense to retake the site. Players who are skilled at using abilities like Viper’s Snake Bite or Brimstone’s Incendiary to deny space are essential in post-plant defense.

Mid-Round Adaptability: On defense, Controllers need to be highly adaptable, repositioning their smokes or walls based on the enemy’s actions. They often play a key role in reacting to information from teammates and adjusting their utility usage to counter enemy strategies.

Recommended Controller Players:
Chobo (Gen.G Black): Chobo is an excellent Controller player, known for her ability to use Omen and Viper to control sightlines and create confusion among attackers. Her strategic use of smokes and utility allows her team to gain an upper hand in defense, especially when holding or retaking sites.

Bonita (CLG Red): A veteran player with strong experience in the Controller role, Bonita excels at using utility to prevent attackers from gaining map control. She is particularly effective with Astra and Brimstone, and her ability to stall pushes with well-placed smokes or delays is critical in defensive setups.
