Selecting Sentinels for Defense

The core of any defensive strategy lies in the Sentinel role, as these agents provide the utility necessary to hold down bomb sites, delay attackers, and prevent flanks. Sentinels excel in defense because of their traps, slows, and healing abilities, which are designed to disrupt attackers and force them into difficult positions. In the Game Changers league, several standout players have demonstrated exceptional proficiency with Sentinels.

Key Attributes of Defensive Sentinels:
Map Control and Area Denial: Sentinels like Killjoy and Cypher are experts at controlling space. They use gadgets, traps, and turrets to secure key parts of the map and prevent attackers from moving freely. Players who are skilled at placing their utility in high-impact areas can lock down entire sections of the map, forcing attackers to waste time or utility to bypass them.

Flank Watch: Sentinels are often tasked with watching flanks and ensuring that no attackers push behind the defenders. Players who are good at monitoring flanks with abilities like Cypher’s tripwires or Killjoy’s Alarm Bot provide essential security, allowing the rest of the team to focus on holding bomb sites.

Utility Timing and Adaptability: Defensive Sentinels need to have excellent timing when deploying their utility. A well-timed slow orb, trap, or turret can completely disrupt an enemy push. Players who are adaptable and can reposition their utility based on the enemy’s approach are invaluable in a defensive setup.

Recommended Sentinel Players:
Flowerful (Shopify Rebellion GC): Flowerful is a standout Sentinel player in the Game Changers scene, excelling with Killjoy and Cypher. She is known for her map control and strategic placement of utility, which consistently disrupts enemy pushes. On defense, Flowerful excels at locking down sites and watching flanks, ensuring her team can focus on more pressing areas.

Laurie (Shopify Rebellion GC): Laurie is another exceptional Sentinel, particularly on agents like Killjoy. She is known for her effective use of gadgets to deny entry into sites and stall attackers, giving her team more time to rotate and set up stronger defenses. Laurie’s defensive utility placement often forces the attackers to slow down and make mistakes.
