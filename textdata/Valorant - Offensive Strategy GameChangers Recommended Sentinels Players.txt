Selecting Sentinels for Offense

Sentinels are often associated with defensive play, but they have important roles to fill in offensive strategies as well. On offense, Sentinels help secure flanks, provide support utility, and hold post-plant positions. They can act as the backbone of an attacking push, locking down areas that the team has taken control of and preventing the defense from retaking too easily.

Key Attributes of Offensive Sentinels:
Flank Watch and Map Control: Sentinels like Killjoy and Cypher can lock down key areas of the map, preventing defenders from flanking or retaking certain zones. Players who are adept at placing traps and gadgets in high-traffic areas are invaluable on offense.

Post-Plant Control: Sentinels are especially valuable in post-plant scenarios, where they can use their utility to delay defuses or stop defenders from retaking the site. Players who can hold key angles and use utility creatively in post-plant situations are critical for maintaining site control.
