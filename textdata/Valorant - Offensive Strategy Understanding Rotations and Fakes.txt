Rotations and Fakes

Flexibility and adaptability are key to a successful offense. Attacking teams should always be ready to rotate based on the situation.

Rotating and Faking: If the defenders have stacked one site or have effectively shut down your push, rotating to another site is often the best option. Fake plays can also be highly effective. For example, making noise or using abilities on A Site can make the defenders believe you're committing to an attack there, but your team can quietly rotate to B Site and plant while defenders are out of position.

Baiting Utility: Another strategy involves baiting out defensive utility. If you know the opposing team has a lot of utility, such as Killjoy’s Nanoswarm or Cypher’s traps, you can fake an initial push, forcing them to use their abilities early. Once their utility is depleted, you can either push the same site with a better chance of success or rotate to another site.
