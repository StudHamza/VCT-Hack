Selecting Controllers for Offense

Controllers play a pivotal role in managing sightlines, blocking vision, and allowing their team to safely execute pushes. A good Controller player knows when and where to place their smokes to give their team the upper hand. In the offensive role, Controllers help ensure safe entry into contested areas and maintain control over key parts of the map.

Key Attributes of Offensive Controllers:
Map Control and Utility Management: Controllers like Viper and Omen can block crucial sightlines, forcing defenders to reposition. Players who are adept at using their smokes strategically to gain control of choke points and open up bomb sites are essential for an offensive strategy.

Mid-Round Adaptability: Controllers often need to adapt based on how the round unfolds. Players who can react quickly and reposition their utility in the middle of a push can turn the tide in favor of their team.
