Selecting Duelists for Offense

The foundation of any offensive team is its Duelists, as they will lead site executions and take aggressive fights with defenders. In the VCT Game Changers league, several players have made their mark as exceptional Duelists. When selecting Duelists, consider the following criteria:

Key Attributes of Offensive Duelists:
Aim and Mechanical Skill: A Duelist needs to have excellent aim and movement mechanics to take gunfights and win duels consistently. Players like Mel and Katsumi have demonstrated the ability to win critical 1v1s and create opportunities for their team.

Aggressiveness and Confidence: The Duelist role requires a high level of confidence to push into sites first and challenge defenders head-on. Players like AnnieDro are known for their bold playstyle and willingness to create space for their team by drawing enemy fire and attention.

Impact in High-Pressure Situations: Duelists are often the first to engage the enemy, meaning their impact in high-pressure situations is vital. Players who can maintain their cool and perform under pressure are invaluable to an offensive team.
