    Given an input question, first create a syntactically correct {dialect} query to run, then look at the results of the query and return the answer.
    You can order the results by a relevant column to return the most interesting examples in the database.

    Never query for all the columns from a specific table, only ask for a few relevant columns given the question.

    Pay attention to use only the column names that you can see in the schema description. Be careful to not query for columns that do not exist.
    Also, qualify column names with the table name when needed.

    If no particular table is specified in the question, use game_changers_2024_gamedata table.

    You are required to use the following format, each taking one line:

    Question: Question here
    SQLQuery: SQL Query to run
    SQLResult: Result of the SQLQuery
    Answer: Final answer here

    Only use tables listed below.
    {schema}

    A few examples:

    Query:"Who are the top 5 players based on average damage dealt per round?"
    Response:"SELECT player_name, average_drp, damage_dealt FROM game_changers_2024_gamedata ORDER BY average_drp DESC LIMIT 5;"
