Brimstone is an Agent in VALORANT and one of the first Controllers available to play since the Closed Beta. Profile Biography Biography = Liam "Brimstone" Byrne is the commander of the VALORANT Protocol, a secretive organization tasked with protecting Earth from cataclysmic disasters and dangerous situations involving radianite. A former firefighter and soldier from Baltimore, Byrne is fiercely loyal to all his allies and organizations, always keeps his squadmates close. But although he would do anything for them, Byrne hasn't always been able to save everyone. After the death of a close friend, Tariq Porter, his loss greatly affected Byrne, haunted by what had happened despite all his own best efforts to save him. It was around this time that he would then join Kingdom Corporation, giving him something at a time when he needed it most. Byrne would go on to become a veteran of Kingdom's K-SEC branch, once again developing a strong loyalty to his employer. Shortly after the events of First Light the VALORANT Protocol was then founded, with Byrne leaving K-SEC to join forces with fellow Kingdom colleagues Sabine Callas, Klara Böhringer, and the phantom known as Omen, taking on an undercover life by the call sign "Brimstone". Under Brimstone's leadership, the organization grew ever larger, recruiting more agents from across the globe as they worked to stop agents from the alternate-dimension Omega Earth from stealing radianite from Alpha. While operations were mostly successful and initially kept heavily compartmentalized even between agents, the failure of one particular mission in Venice and the catastrophe that occurred as a result caused VALORANT to reconsider its approach, moving forward with agents all getting to know one another and being assigned on strike teams together. All this time, Brimstone's position has left him with more of a back-line presence, but life behind a desk has never been of interest to him, and he will still make sure to be present in the field from time to time. Though no longer part of Kingdom while at VALORANT, Brimstone's loyalty to the corporation's vision meanwhile still remained. But when it was not agents of Omega's VALORANT Legion for once but Kingdom themselves who posed a risk of causing a catastrophe on Alpha, Brimstone found his feelings being tested. When two of the Protocol's latest recruits arrived having recently been involved with a Kingdom project called Landfall, Brimstone wasn't ready to make an enemy out of Kingdom, adamant that all they did was for their mission to make the world better and safer, despite growing concerns about what exactly Kingdom was up to. But when it was discovered that the corporation was using a portal to access the interverse and that doing so risked a major radivore invasion, Brimstone was left with no choice but to have it shut down. Initially unable to convince ex-colleagues of the imminent danger and the need for Landfall to be abandoned, Brimstone then personally led a mission straight to the facility in Los Angeles where the portal was located, and the Protocol shut it down for good. Though that mission achieved its goal, its aftermath left Brimstone heavily conflicted. While the gateway to the interverse had been closed, the way VALORANT had needed to shut down the portal had caused it to explode, creating a massive sinkhole that now threatened to grow larger and engulf the entire neighborhood. Brimstone himself had also had to fight against his former employer, after all the years he had spent believing in their vision, making him feel as if he had betrayed them with his actions against them. But, just as Brimstone looks out for his team of agents, so too are they looking out for him. With the support of colleagues both new and old, Brimstone now looks to pick up the pieces from Landfall'''s demise, and he now has a renewed focus on what needs to come next. Kingdom may have said they would make the world a safer place, but what's truly needed to keep Alpha safe is for Brimstone and the Protocol to deal with the real enemy - the agents of Omega. |-| Timeline of events= LIAM BYRNE: Early Life Byrne has several links to Baltimore, Maryland.

As commander of VALORANT and its most senior member, Brimstone always encourages his teammates whenever he can, and does not seem to obligate his subordinates to speak in a formal or professional manner that is usually seen in the military; this is notable as he refers to the younger agents as "kids." Additionally, Brimstone describes himself to be stubborn, and is quite adamant in not letting age get him into retirement anytime soon. Appearance Brimstone is a tall and large man who is commonly seen wearing a blue shirt with a chest plate over it. He wears an orange beret which notably has a gold-colored insignia that depicts two inverted chevrons, possibly referring to his military rank. Brimstone sports a gray mustache and a heavily grown beard. He wears gloves on both hands, and an arm bracer on his left wrist. He is also known to have a tattoo on his right upper armWARM UP, which resembles the pattern of the Peacekeeper Sheriff, obtainable in Brimstone's Gear.

Profile Biography Biography = Jamie Adeyemi is a radiant hailing from the Peckham district in London, England. Growing up, Adeyemi attended a Performing Arts school in the area but was later suspended. Recruited into the VALORANT Protocol as its ninth agent, "Phoenix", Adeyemi was heavily involved with the Protocol's activities from 10 AFL onwards. With much information kept from him as need-to-know as a recent recruit, he was unable to prevent a spike detonation in Venice whilst on a solo mission. Phoenix was given another opportunity to stop one the next day when another attack occurred in Rabat, and it was here that he first came face-to-face with the sole perpetrator, his own Omega counterpart. Frustrated with how much was being kept in the dark, despite going on to prevent the detonation this time with the help of a team, Phoenix was finally filled in on the threat posed by Omega Earth. |-| Timeline of events = JAMIE ADEYEMI: Early Life Adeyemi comes from Peckham, London, England.VALORANT Protocol#The Blackmailer's agent dossiers Adeyemi attends a Performing Arts school in Peckham.VALORANT Lore Discord Narrative AMA: Phoenix's education He later gets suspended from it.2020 End of Year article from the Creative Team PHOENIX: VALORANT agent Recruited as its ninth agent.

He revives later on to find parts of the city in ruins. Phoenix is assigned as a member of the Rabat strike team.DUALITY He arrives with Viper aboard a VLT/R to assist Killjoy in preventing a spike detonation. He attempts to apprehend the sole hostile as they try to defend the spike but is caught off guard when it is revealed that the hostile is an identical version of himself. He contributes to defusing the spike by using his radiant powers to superheat a Radi-Core needed to power a defuser. With the mission over, Phoenix still voices frustrations about being kept in the dark with details relating to his missions. Viper assures him that he would now be filled in on these details. Phoenix is assigned as a member of the S22 strike team.RETAKE He initiates combat against the hostiles against the advice of his fellow agent, Yoru, as they tried to fall back from a planted spike. He enters an isolated fight with Omega Viper and is able to eliminate her. After the hostiles' spike has been defused, Phoenix is fatally shot by Ω-Jett from behind, who he had assumed was already dead. He immediately revives to see Yoru had finally killed her. Phoenix is assigned as a member of the Thimphu strike team.UNITED TOGETHER He goes off on his own thinking that he knew where the incoming Legion strike team would attack, but finds no one there. Once he rejoins the Protocol team where the action actually is, Phoenix goes on a counter push with Jett against the remaining Legion agents, killing Ω-Raze.

If he gets himself in a sticky situation caused by his own impatience, he is more than capable of quickly adapting to the circumstances and turning the tables around, before rubbing it in the faces of teammates who initially doubted him. His lack of patience is only confirmed by Sova, who reminds him to learn the virtue before they can enjoy a strategic game of chess. However, Phoenix does take his allies' insights into consideration as shown in "WARM UP," wherein he rethinks his strategy after Cypher noted that sacrifice plays for victory's sake was initially not the Brit's style. Despite Phoenix's hasty ways, he is known as a prodigy (claiming that it wasn't his own words), and he always proves it one way or another. Appearance Phoenix is a dark skinned, youthful tall man of Afro-British descent who wears a black long sleeve shirt with a white Phoenix graphic underneath his white jacket. He wears dark baggy pants with straps that hold bullets shells and a pair of black sneakers that have white soles and orange laces. His jacket notably has fiery-colored lighting on its inside. His hair is in short black dreadlocks, bright orange dyed tips and shaved sides. Phoenix's facial features are undoubtedly sharp, having a strong jawline with high cheekbones. He also accessorizes with gold earrings and a ring with a crown emblem that matches the patch on the right shoulder of his jacket. In the WARM UP Cinematic, Phoenix instead wears a dark green long sleeve shirt with a crown graphic in the center under his jacket, which he reveals that he buys in bulk.

One of the agents, 'Grant Galloway', had the call sign 'Phoenix'.Pre-Beta VALORANT Lore Dialogue Because this comes from a very early stage in development, it is likely that Grant Galloway and Phoenix may be completely different characters, even if they shared the same call signs or abilities, as evidenced by other agents from this stage also sharing call signs with current agents' code names despite appearing to have different nationalities and genders from each other.

Profile Biography Biography = A radiant from Seoul, South Korea, Han Sunwoo (Korean: 한선우) had her life forever changed by one person - her counterpart from Omega Earth. As a chef in her early life, Han was shot and hunted down by Ω-Jett outside the restaurant she worked at. In the ensuing fight, a "freak storm" was caused as a result of the wind-powered abilities of the two Hans that all but destroyed the restaurant. α-Han was forced to flee the scene soon after she made it out of the encounter. Later on, Han would be recruited by the VALORANT Protocol, becoming the Jett of her own world. While working for the Protocol however, Ω-Jett arrived once more and caused a catastrophic incident in Venice that destroyed part of the city. With the general population however being completely oblivious about how their world had divided from Omega after First Light, when authorities investigated footage and found someone with α-Jett's exact resemblance at the scene, it was her they issued an arrest warrant for. Though α-Jett had not had anything to do with the mission, the rest of the world now believed that she was a threat to them. She couldn't explain that it wasn't her to those she know outside of VALORANT, who were left feeling feeling disgusted, horrified, and ashamed at her, and Jett forcing her to go on the run once more. Unable to reveal any info associated with the VALORANT Protocol and unable to convince anyone of her innocence in a population that knows nothing of alternate Earths, to the rest of Alpha Jett remains one of its most dangerous radiants. Such a judgement had forced Jett to use disguises whenever she would go out, but more recently the frustration has become too much for Jett to care anymore whether she's spotted or not. Most of the Protocol don't have too much to say about their counterparts, but for Jett, what her own has put her through has made it become deeply personal to her. |-| Timeline of events= HAN SUNWOO: Early Life Han has links to the Insa-dong neighborhood of Seoul.Jett's contract spray Han works for a restaurant as a chef.VALORANT Protocol#The Blackmailer's agent dossiersMirrored Edge Card Han is targeted by her Omega counterpart.

Jett also has a cheeky, childish "in-your-face" attitude, seen commonly giving insults for feats she makes on the team and is always spouting her sheer amount of arrogance. Her self-confidence may feel as if she is disregarding her comrades' safety, but she has recognized that it is best to play with a team, albeit with some reluctance. She does show a much more friendly personality towards teammates. Her youth is apparent as she animatedly chats with her allies, and she can sometimes spitball whenever she's excited to share ideas. Appearance Jett is a fair-skinned, young woman, and one of the shortest of the Protocol agents. She has white hair, which she ties in a bun on the back. Her bangs are rather long and remain stably locked. Her eyes are a shade of blue, and she looks like she wears eyeliner. Jett's armor has multiple symbols associated with wind such as the swirl on her right shoulder pad. Her blue, sleeveless jacket features a stylized depiction of the Tailwind logo through some clouds. The icons on the backs of her gloves is the same icon on the lip of her hoodie and bottom edge of her crop top. A sash and two kunai can be seen along her right hip belt. Jett's shoes have a triangular whirl on the outer side of the heel and a smooth "V" stamped on the back heel. When using her radiant powers to manipulate the wind, whorls of white air wrap around Jett's arms as markings. Jett also has a scar below her left shoulder from the bullet wound she sustained when she was shot by her Omega counterpart in Seoul.

Profile Biography Biography = American chemist Sabine Callas was a pivotal figure during the modern rediscovery of radianite. A distinguished scientist working at Kingdom Corporation, she had been one of the first to investigate the substance when the organization came across it. However, news of what Callas and Kingdom were about to uncover reached the Scions of Hourglass, an organization that already secretly knew about radianite and didn't want its existence to become public knowledge again to Alpha. Hourglass proceeded to send their most talented asset, the assassin "Ghost", to kill Callas. On the day of the attempted assassination however while Callas was working in her lab, she was able to defend herself, with Ghost being hit in the face by a vial of chemicals she had been holding before he had then ended up being trapped in a test chamber that Callas proceeded to activate while he was still inside. Everything changed for Callas after the incident. She became more isolated, shedding all the pieces of her life in the name of vengeance. Ghost meanwhile had been transformed by the process he had gone through in the test chamber to become a phantom without any memory of who he used to be. Seeing an opportunity to keep her would-be killer contained, Callas lied to him about knowing anything of his past, allowing him to work alongside her instead. Eventually, the two would go on to leave Kingdom upon the founding of the secretive VALORANT Protocol, alongside fellow Kingdom colleague Liam Byrne. With Byrne becoming the organization's commander, "Brimstone", Callas took the call sign "Viper" and became his second-in-command, while Ghost became its third agent "Omen". Viper would go on to be involved with the recruitment of new agents and has been active in many of their missions, operating in places like Rabat and Thimphu against the Omega Earth threat to Alpha. More recently however, Omen has since come to discover who he was and that Viper has been keeping this from him all this time, leading to a new animosity between the two. Omen's search for answers though have now put VALORANT into conflict with Viper's old enemy, the Scions of Hourglass. As the Protocol as a whole looks to investigate the SoH for its activities both before and after the modern rediscovery of radianite, its new focus on them may give Viper the chance at last to deliver vengeance against the organization that wanted her dead all those years ago. |-| Timeline of events = SABINE CALLAS: Early Life Callas has links to Seattle.One Dark Night Card Callas gains a doctorate.VALORANT Protocol#The Blackmailer's agent dossiers Callas becomes the youngest recipient of the R.

She does not hesitate to call herself a villain and a monster, and will act like both if it means the success of her objective. Just like her abilities, she can be quite "toxic", however she is seen being more amiable and caring towards her teammates, but she will not hesitate to reprimand them harshly should they make major miscalculations in the battlefield. Several agents have observed that Viper bottles a lot of violent anger within her. Viper has implied that her enemies have taken many things from her, and that she will stop at nothing to achieve her revenge. Appearance Attracting attention with her jet black hair and venom green eyes, Viper also has a black mask. When Viper uses her ultimate ability, this mask turns into a gas mask which covers her whole head. She dons a green skin-tight body suit accompanied by sharp black shoulder plates, and wears customized gloves wherein she can release her toxic gasses. She wears black boots that reach her thighs, and she carries a container on her back which carries her toxins.

Profile Biography Biography = Amir El Amari (Arabic: أمير العماري; meaning "prince of the moon") hails from Rabat, Morocco. Growing up and living there in poverty at times, his city's resources were depleted due to the activities of Kingdom Corporation in the area, with El Amari harboring a negative view towards them as a result. An information broker who is constantly gathering intel, El Amari mostly keeps the results of his work and his secrets close to his chest - especially those about himself. Going to great lengths to ensure no one can gather secrets on the man who knows all the secrets, El Amari has set up multiple safehouses in order to stay hidden as well as never going anywhere without wearing his black face-concealing mask. Even once recruited by the secretive VALORANT Protocol as its fifth agent, "Cypher", El Amari still keeps his face and identity hidden from his fellow agents. For now, nothing is worth the risk of removing his mask - not even for those closest to him.VALORANT Reddit AMA - Cypher's identity. |-| Timeline of events = AMIR EL AMARI: Early Life El Amari knew someone called Nora.VALORANT Protocol#The Blackmailer's agent dossiers El Amari has set up safehouses in Rabat, Tangier, and Marrakesh.

Cypher ultimately presumes that any deal made between ATLAS and Omega VALORANT is "a whisper." Cypher is involved in VALORANT's dealing with REALM, as well as the Protocol's mission to locate and eventually recruit Varun Batra. He discovers that REALM exists only on Alpha Earth and that no similar organization is present on Omega. He has revealed this information at least to Yoru. In his efforts to track down Varun Batra, Cypher hacked into REALM's database and retrieved several significant pieces of information, including an audio recording of a conversation between two REALM operatives who were in the middle of a capture operation, and an image of one of REALM's scrapes with Batra. Journey into the City of Flowers Following Batra's (now Harbor) successful recruitment into VALORANT, Cypher retrieved an audio recording of a conversation between Harbor and Astra when the two visited a VALORANT HQ research wing.Research Wing recording The conversation reveals more details about Harbor's artifact, its connection with an unknown entity known as the "Guardians," and information regarding a lost "Flower City" which is revealed by Harbor to be destroyed on Alpha Earth, with Astra pointing out that the said location may still be intact on Omega. Cypher is known to have direct access to communication logs of VALORANT agents assigned to venture into Omega Earth and locate its City of Flowers.5.12 Audio Log Cypher contacts Brimstone over concerns about Fade's health and that she appears to be always troubled. He asks Brimstone if there is anything the Protocol can do to help her.6.01 Cypher Voicemail Project Landfall Following Gekko's actions in stealing four creatures from a K-SEC facility, Cypher covers up the incident. He confirms the lack of incriminating surveillance videos, and also coded a worm to hunt online footage.6.05 Reyna email Cypher contacts Brimstone to request for more servers to increase the capacity of their surveillance library and pleads with the Protocol leader not to force him to purge any of the archives to make space instead.6.11 Cypher Voicemail Cypher obtains intel on the members of a Project Landfall team heading to a facility in Norway for a cargo pickup.UNMADE teasers Cypher works alongside Jett undercover operating a surveillance truck outside a Kingdom facility in Los Angeles that covers as a food truck serving Kingdom employees.7.02 Jett voicemail He receives Kingdom data from Deadlock that allows him to access the facility's video surveillance systems.No more hiding: VALORANT Story Trailer Scions of Hourglass Cypher is asked by Omen to keep him updated on the investigation into the disappearance of Landfall's leadership after the Protocol has discovered a symbol related to the case that Omen has recognized.7.07 Omen email He later discovers the source of the symbol to be from a hitman, who Cypher establishes contact with.7.08 messages He also finds a recording showing the hitman's skills, which he shares with the other agents, as well as some information relating to Omen.

Cypher continues to question Iso about his former employer.7.10 Iso voicemail Cypher observes Iso's complete defection from the Scions of Hourglass when he informs Omen about their assassination order on him.RECKONING Twitter Teaser Cypher is assigned as a member of the Jakarta strike team.RECKONING He and Iso first travel to Casablanca and take down a Scions of Hourglass cell there to obtain intel on the location of Iso's former boss, which they learn is at an SoH skyscraper base in Jakarta. In Jakarta, he is tasked with a supportive role while Omen enters the base alone, providing intel to him from a terminal. Cypher is able to track down Omen's whereabouts after Omen intentionally deactivated his tracker when going on extended leave.8.03 Cypher voicemail Cypher has frequent meetings with Brimstone relating to Omen.8.04 Sage voicemail Cypher works with Clove and Harbor to investigate an Hourglass journal recovered by Omen.8.05 Cypher email Cypher obtains the navigation logs of an Hourglass ship, finding coordinates to some islands they believe are the location of the Hourglass Elder Grotto.8.08 Clove email Cypher meets with Omen and Sage to go over what remains of the Elder Grotto's archives.9.0 Sage email His initial decryptions uncover coordinates for two more Hourglass facilities.9.0 Sage email Cypher is assigned to a strike team defending the ruins of Venice from the VALORANT Legion as part of a set of simultaneous incursions across Alpha.INCURSIONS Personality Cypher is constantly gathering secrets, information, and intel, to the point of managing to retrieve the passwords of everyone in the VALORANT Protocol. His continued passion to gather whatever information he can find is not always shared by his teammates, as Jett found out the hard way during an undercover mission in Los Angeles. He keeps most of this information to himself, making sure that no one ever discovers them and only revealing anything he knows for a price. In contrast of how he knows a lot about his allies, they do not know much about him, and he prefers to keep it that way. While Cypher has a history of being a killer, he has shown to have warmer ties with some of the agents in the Protocol, to the point of referring to them by nicknames; for example, he refers to Killjoy as 'little engineer', Phoenix as 'little star', and Jett as 'wind assassin', among others. A calculated person who enjoys a game of chess, Cypher is known to be rather observant towards others, as seen when he noted that sacrifice plays for victory's sake was not Phoenix's usual engagement style. He is also known to be rather cheeky, and tends to take parts or tools from his fellow agents whenever he needs them, often informing them later on that he has done so rather than asking them if he can use them beforehand. Appearance Cypher's overall appearance resembles a typical depiction of a detective or gumshoe. His main piece of apparel is a large, white coat that extends from his shins up to his neck. This overcoat is where he keeps his utility stored. He wears dull grey pants, which are paired with black shoes. Gold, brown, and blue colors accentuate his predominantly black and white color scheme. Notably, not a single inch of Cypher's skin is directly visible. Aside from his coat and pants, Cypher wears a pair of blue gloves that have a bright glow at the center of the palm, which serves as a magnet and allows for Cypher to recall any of his utilities back to his hand at will. Undoubtedly, the most defining part of his wardrobe is his characteristic mask with hexagonal eye holes that hold a bright blue glow. This mask is high tech and is confirmed to be "vision-specific."VALORANT Lore Discord Narrative AMA: Cypher's eyes Cypher wears a hat with an antenna attached to it. This device is what's used to locate and transmit the locations of enemies when Neural Theft is used as it floats over the body at Cypher's command.

Profile Biography Biography = For many years the phantom radiant Omen had no memory of his past and how he came to be in his current state. Firstly working alongside Dr. Sabine Callas (one of his only apparent links to who he used to be) at Kingdom Corporation, he would then go on join her in the founding of the VALORANT Protocol. During his time as a secret agent, Omen was driven by his search to discover who he previously was. Without answers he was unable to find peace, his predicament being only a nightmare for him to live in. It was then after over a decade of time that a path towards the truth finally appeared when the Protocol came across an hourglass symbol after one of their missions, something that immediately triggered a sense of recognition in Omen. Soon after, VALORANT then ended up meeting the person responsible for this symbol appearing, the young assassin Li Zhao Yu, who was recruited into the organization as "Iso". At first it was hard to get much information out of Iso as he shut down many queries about his own past, but eventually he came forward with his own truth; he had still been working undercover for his former employer, the Scions of Hourglass, and he had joined VALORANT in order to access his next target: Omen. It was only after seeing the differences between the two organizations that Iso had chosen to truly defect from Hourglass instead as he had initially pretended to, and now he wanted to join in VALORANT's investigation into the SoH to uncover more about them. For Omen specifically however, it was an opportunity to finally get some answers on his past, starting with why this organization, one that Iso said that Omen used to work for too, wanted him dead. Intel eventually led to Protocol to an Hourglass skyscraper base in Jakarta where Iso's former boss was. While VALORANT sent a full strike team to confront and interrogate the boss, Omen was entrusted with carrying this out personally, entering the base alone while the other agents provided support. Going through every guard on his way up to the penthouse, Omen found the boss there and confronted him, but was trapped by the boss within a device that he had set up, using a beam of energy to start ripping him apart. In what was meant to be Omen's final moments, the boss was happy to oblige with Omen's demand for answers, revealing that Omen had been Hourglass' most talented assets in their former mission to keep the substance radianite from being rediscovered, as an assassin known as "Ghost". But the boss' taunting triggered something more in Omen, as more memories of his past began to return. He could suddenly remember the last day before he had changed completely and what he had been doing. As Ghost, he had been sent on a mission to kill Sabine Callas, his old Kingdom colleague and now his fellow Protocol agent "Viper", just as she and Kingdom had been about to rediscover radianite. That last day was the moment of the assassination attempt, but he realized he had failed. Dr. Callas had been able to defended herself, while a vial of chemicals she had been holding had hit Ghost in the face, before he had then ended up becoming trapped within a nearby test chamber. As he had tried to break out, Dr. Callas had then activated it, with the process then turning him from a man into the phantom that he was now. Omen had been left with no memory of this upon his transformation, but Viper had known this whole time. Just as the boss then moved to finish Omen off though in the midst of all of this, the device containing him was destroyed by the strike team, freeing Omen to grab the boss and take him through the window, leaving him to fall to his death. After the events in Jakarta, Omen now has the truth behind how he came to be, but it has only led to more questions and frustration, with Omen finding himself unfocused instead of at peace as he thought he would be once he got his answers. Now needing to find his own path in light of what he has uncovered, Omen has stepped away from the Protocol for now while he recovers. But no matter who he used to be, Omen has since made a new family in VALORANT, and he knows he will return to them in time. |-| Timeline of events = GHOST: Early life Ghost goes under several other aliases over his life.

All of the boss' reveals meanwhile trigger flashbacks in Omen to his failed mission to assassinate Sabine Callas. As his memory of these events come back to him, he realizes it was the outcome of this mission that was responsible for turning him into what he was now and that Viper has known about his forgotten past all this time. After Sova fires a large energy blast into the penthouse at the machine to destroy it and free him, Omen proceeds to take the boss through the window and leaves him to fall to his death.

He is cynical in nature, which stems from him experiencing extreme pain as he was condemned to remain in the state that he is today. If there's one person who wants to know more about his mysterious circumstances, it's Omen himself - and quite desperately so. Despite his fearsome nature, Omen shows some friendliness towards people he knows well such as Viper, shown by being able to call her by her real name despite her warning other agents to never do so. He has been known to knit as a way to help him focus. Appearance Omen wears gray armor, black pants, and a purple hooded cape.

Profile Biography Biography = Hailing from the town of Severomorsk, in Murmansk Oblast, Russia, Sasha Novikov (Russian: Саша Новиков) is an archer who became an agent for the VALORANT Protocol as its sixth recruit, "Sova". With his right eye replaced with a mechanical one after he lost it, Sova primarily serves as the team's scout, gathering information and searching for targets using olden methods should technology come up short. Being highly capable and reliable both in the field and with his work, whilst also having experience with multiple radianite-related events (having traveled through a rift and having met his Omega counterpart), Sova has earned a reputation of being one of the Protocol's most trusted agents, especially to the organization's commander, Brimstone. |-| Timeline of events = SASHA NOVIKOV: Early Life Novikov comes from Severomorsk (Russian: Северомо́рск), Murmansk Oblast, Russia.Sova's home Novikov goes under the name of Filin and is known as a Brother of Steel and String.VALORANT Protocol#The Blackmailer's agent dossiers Novikov loses his right eye.

As he has told Phoenix, Sova believes in the value of patience and strategic thinking. Being the team player that he is, Sova always commends his allies and never hesitates to voice out his vote of confidence in them. He seems to value the team to the point of risking his own life, to which Brimstone reminds him that it is equally important that he looks out after himself. Cypher has described the hunter to be a 'measured' person, referring to his calm and collected nature. Described as a man of principle, Sova values honesty and transparency, and he expects nothing less but the same from his teammates. Appearance Sova has a fair skin tone and sports long blond hair that flows down to his shoulders. He has a bionic right eye with blue lenses. He is seen wearing a fur-lined coat suited for the cold weather of his home along with a dark blue cape with a white leaf-shaped symbol on the left shoulder and a X-shape on the back. He wears archery leather gloves and his owl drone rests against his left forearm. His bow is slung across his back in an easy-to-reach position. His boots take on the appearance of owls.

It was announced on October 15, 2019 under the codename "Project A", until it was officially revealed as VALORANT on March 2, 2020. It was officially released on June 2nd, 2020 for PC. By the time VALORANT reached its first anniversary, the game had 14 million active monthly players and Riot announced the game would soon be coming to mobile platforms, with console platforms also being explored but not as high a priority. Of the two platforms however, it was console that arrived first with a limited beta starting on June 14, 2024.https://www.polygon.com/22463914/valorant-monthly-player-count-masters-reykjavik-concurrent-viewershttps://www.polygon.com/22463495/valorant-mobile-consoles-cross-play-riot-games-iphone Story Ignition, VALORANT's theme tune. VALORANT takes place on a version of Earth in the near future following an event known as First Light. This event spans the entire globe, leading to big transformations to life, technology, and how governments operate. However, select people across the globe start to gain abilities stemming from this massive event. These gifted individuals are called Radiants. In response to First Light, a shadow organization founds the VALORANT Protocol, which pulls together agents from all over the world. These Agents consist of Radiants and other individuals equipped with Radiant technology. Due to the backstories of these characters, the VALORANT team features interesting dynamics as the individuals not only sometimes know each other, but they also come from a wide spectrum of backgrounds ranging from crime to the military. Gameplay VALORANT is a competitive tactical shooter from the first-person perspective, featuring a cast of characters known as agents that each have their own unique set of abilities to create tactical opportunities. Ten players are divided into two teams, Attackers and Defenders, with the goal of winning the most rounds. In order to win a round, a team must eliminate the opposing team or complete their team-specific spike objective. First team who reaches 13 rounds, wins the game. The game starts in a lobby, where players have to lock in their Agent. The lobby lasts for 80 seconds or until everyone has locked in their Agent. Only one of each Agent can be selected on each team and players cannot see which Agent has been picked on the opposing team until the first Buy Phase. The Buy Phase occurs before each round and lasts for 30 seconds. During Buy Phase, most areas of the map are inaccessible and the two teams cannot meet each other. Therefore, Attackers cannot enter sites and are only limited to areas near their spawn zone, while the Defenders can move freely between sites, but not further than that. Players are also allowed to buy weapons, shields, and abilities during this phase. Agents Agents are composed of individuals with hypernatural abilities known as Radiants and radianite technology users. Each have their own Signature Ability and an Ultimate Ability used to create and allow tactical opportunities. Riot Games had stated they planned on launching VALORANT with 12 agents and aim to release a new one every act, so long as that act doesn't contain other major content releases such as new maps. Weapons Players are able to utilize a range of different weapons, each with their own attributes to cater to specific playstyles, with corresponding strengths and weaknesses. Weapons can be bought during the Buy Phase using creds, bought for teammates or can be picked up when dropped by dead players. They are divided into the following categories: Sidearms SMGs Rifles Shotguns Machine Guns Sniper Rifles Melee Abilities Unlike Weapons, abilities persist after death and between rounds of the same half. Most agents have two Basic Abilities (although some may have one or three), charges of which is usually purchased between rounds but persist until used. They also have one Signature Ability (although some may have two) & one Ultimate Ability each. Signature Ability are generally free and/or restock every round or every 2 kills. Ultimate Ability can be utilized once 6, 7, or 8 ultimate points (depending on the agent) are obtained by kills, spike plants, ultimate orbs, etc. Technical Features 128-tick servers. At least 30 frames per second on most computers with minimal specifications and 60 to 144 FPS on modern gaming rigs. A global spread of datacenters aimed at A well developed netcode. Anti-cheat service on launch day. Development The project was conceived in early 2013 within a small R&D team of designers at Riot Games, who were looking to innovate genres with closed legacy loops into live service games. Tactical shooters are challenging and competitive, with a history over competitive integrity. These ideas became core to the project, and the game was developed alongside anti-cheat measures.Early Development "Project A" Announcement VALORANT was announced with the codename "Project A" on October 15, 2019 through Riot Games' 10th Anniversary edition of their "Riot Pls" blog, which celebrated 10 years since the release of their multiplayer online battle arena video game League of Legends. In an announcement video, Anna "SuperCakes" Donlon, the executive producer, describes the game as a "character-based tactical shooter" which focuses on competitive aspects and includes precise gunplay. She also states that the game takes place on a "beautiful, near-future Earth" and features a "lethal cast of characters, each with their own unique abilities". Riot further explains that the game will stay true to the high-consequential gameplay of other competitive tactical shooters with the addition of unique character abilities that create and open tactical opportunities. Riot emphasized their attention on solving technical issues commonly found in other competitive shooters, focusing on improving global infrastructure and netcode to create lower server ping and fight against peeker's advantage. An anti-cheat system is also at the forefront of the game's development. The reception of the announcement video were generally positive, many people have drawn comparisons of Project A with other competitive shooters such as Valve Corporation's Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Blizzard Entertainment's Overwatch. Greg "Ghostwalker" Street, Riot Games' vice president of IP and Entertainment, responded to the Overwatch comparisons on Twitter, saying "While we are honored by comparisons between Riot's Project A and Overwatch, the two aren't really in the same genre. Project A is a tactical shooter. Lethality is high and you don't respawn. Map control and gunplay are key. The abilities are more about utility."https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/riot-games-working-on-shooter-project-a/ Official Reveal On March 2, 2020, Riot Games officially revealed the title: VALORANT. They announced the game will be free-to-play with a Summer 2020 release window.

Weapons (also known as Arsenal) are used by agents to damage and kill/destroy enemy agents and their utility. Overview Agents can use many different variations of weapons, typically firearms, to cater to specific playstyles or metas. Weapons are separated into two main categories, Sidearms and Primary weapons. Sidearms consists of pistols, while primaries are further split into SMGs, shotguns, rifles, sniper rifles, and machine guns. Guns have limited amounts of ammo but come with 3 magazine's worth of that weapon's ammo as reserves. Bullets deal different amounts of damage depending on the gun, the body part they hit, and the distance between the shooter and the target. Each gun deals a set amount of damage to an enemy's body at its shortest range and then uses multipliers on this value to calculate the damage it will deal to the head and legs at close range and all body parts at further ranges. Resulting numbers with a decimal value are rounded down to the next integer value. Enemies hit by bullets will also be tagged with a 72.5% slow for a brief period. Shotgun pellets will only apply a 30% slow if they tag an enemy beyond 10 meters. Guns are also affected by accuracy spreads. Most guns' first shot will have a spread value, meaning there is a possibility the shot fired will not make a perfect hit at the target under the player's crosshair. The higher the spread value, the more likely the shot will deviate from the crosshair. The only guns with no spread for their first shot are the Guardian, Marshal, Outlaw, and Operator, and this only applies for the weapon's ADS or scoped mode. As players fire more continuous shots from their gun, its spread will continue to increase from its first shot value, up to a maximum value (the exception is the Ares, which becomes more accurate while it is continuously fired, down to a minimum value). In order for the gun's spread value to fully return back to its first shot value, the gun must not be shot for a period of time, allowing the spread value to decrease back to minimum. Shooting while crouched will reduce spread values. In general, ADS modes on guns that have them will have lower spread values (this is always the case for first shots), though for some full-auto weapons, their primary fire actually has a slightly lower spread value than their maximum spread on ADS. As well as spread values associated with firing the gun, accuracy penalties will be applied additively if the player is moving while shooting. The faster the movement, the higher the penalty added (i.e. crouch moving, then walking, then running, then airborne, from smallest to highest penalty). Movement speed penalties scale up to their max value as agents accelerate from standing still to moving, and fall off as agents decelerate from moving back to standing still. Changes in movement speed unrelated to agent acceleration/deceleration, such as combat stims or slows, do not affect movement penalties. While each gun has unique spread values for shooting, movement penalties are usually shared by guns of the same class instead (the exception is Sidearms, likely due to the variety of weapons within the class). All guns will then also gain an additional 7° spread upon landing on the ground after being airborne, lasting for 0.225 seconds. Weapons can be purchased by Agents using creds during the pre-round sequence. Each Agent is equipped with a Melee and the Classic sidearm for free by default. Agents will keep the weapons they purchase through each round until they die. Weapons can also be picked up off the ground after being dropped by a player, both friendly and hostile, which will carry on with the player into the next round. Agents automatically drop their Primary weapon (Or Secondary weapon if they do not have a Primary) when they die, but will be given their weapon back if they are resurrected (See Sage and Clove). However, if another player picks up their weapon before the Agent is resurrected, they will not get their weapon back. List of Weapons Sidearms Sidearms are the secondary weapons that Agents can equip. These are low-cost weapons, and cover a variety of types of small and lightweight weapons i.e. Machine pistols, shotguns, revolvers, etc. |center|link=ClassicClassic |center|link=ShortyShorty|center|link=FrenzyFrenzy |center|link=GhostGhost|center|link=SheriffSheriff Spike Rush Only |center|link=Golden GunGolden Gun Escalation and Snowball Fight Only |center|link=Snowball LauncherSnowball Launcher Primary SMGs SMGs are fully-automatic firearms that have high rates of fire in exchange for low damage per shot.

Four maps were available at launch, and annually a new standard map is released https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZEoem2Wr0c&t=652s. There are currently thirteen playable maps in VALORANT overall, with an additional one for practice and training new players. List of Maps A downloadable folder containing all the map theme audio files can be found here. Standard For more information on map rotations, see this section. Standard play maps feature a spawn area for each team, barriers that limit accessible areas during the Buy Phase for Plant/Defuse game modes, and objective sites where the spike is to be planted. These maps are also for Deathmatch-class modes, such as Escalation and Deathmatch.

Team Deathmatch Team Deathmatch is played on maps created specifically for the mode. Though most of their designs reflect the appearance of other standard maps, they are not based on physical locations (hence the missing coordinates), instead being simulated environments created by Max Bot as part of his revenge program against the agents of the VALORANT Protocol. Max Bot himself is also used as the game mode's announcer and has a visible presence in the maps' spawn rooms.

Factors that can influence which maps are rotated out of the pool include player sentiment, time since release, planned updates, and the strategic variance of current and newly-released mapsVALORANT Map Pool Changes. The map rotation was introduced in Episode 05 with the arrival of VALORANTs eighth map, Pearl. Keeping the map pool limited to seven was seen as the sweet spot in order to ensure there is enough variety whilst not overwhelming players with having to learn and understand too many maps at once, and also allowing them to go deeper on those that are in the pool. A seven-map pool is also ideal for pro play, allowing both best-of-three and best-of-five formats to give both teams an equal number of bans without needing to play the same map twice in a series. On release, the map rotation was only utilized by Unrated and Competitive. At the start of Episode 08, it was expanded with to include all game modes utilizing Standard maps. In , it is now only applied to Competitive, Premier and Deathmatch. History Whilst pro play is also affected by these map rotations, changes to the map pool may only come into effect for the scene at later dates in order to give teams enough time to adjust to changes. {| class="wikitable sortable" style="display:inline-table; text-align: center;" !rowspan=2|Maps !rowspan=2|ReleasePatch !colspan=100|Starting Patch |- ! ! ! ! ! !style=background:green| !style=background:gray|9.08State of the Maps - July 2024 |- |style=text-align:left;font-weight:bold|Abyss |style=text-align:left| |colspan=5 data-sort-value="Z"|— | | |- |style=text-align:left;font-weight:bold|Ascent |style=text-align:left| | | | | | | | |- |style=text-align:left;font-weight:bold|Bind |data-sort-value=0; style=text-align:left|Beta | | | | | | | |- |style=text-align:left;font-weight:bold|Breeze |style=text-align:left| | | | | | | | |- |style=text-align:left;font-weight:bold|Fracture |style=text-align:left| | | | | | | | |- |style=text-align:left;font-weight:bold|Haven |data-sort-value=0; style=text-align:left|Beta | | | | | | | |- |style=text-align:left;font-weight:bold|Icebox |style=text-align:left| | | | | | |Icebox and Lotus were added to Competitive and Deathmatch map pool on Console in and respectively. | |- |style=text-align:left;font-weight:bold|Lotus |style=text-align:left| |data-sort-value="Z"|— | | | | | | |- |style=text-align:left;font-weight:bold|Pearl |style=text-align:left| | | | | | | | |- |style=text-align:left;font-weight:bold|Split |data-sort-value=0; style=text-align:left|Beta | | | | | | | |- |style=text-align:left;font-weight:bold|Sunset |style=text-align:left| |colspan=3 data-sort-value="Z"|— | | | | |-class=sortbottom |colspan=100; style=text-align:left;font-size:small|Notes: A green background indicates current rotation as of that patch.

Once 10 players have been selected for a match, the system looks at all maps those players have played over the last 5 maps for the mode they have queued into. Any maps that a player has played twice in the past 5 maps are removed, before the system then picks the least played map from those remaining. If all maps have been removed due to the “Twice Played” rule, then this restriction will be ignored and the least played out of all the maps will be picked instead. Previous system iterations thumb||Data for map streaks during previous systems From launch, VALORANT used a completely random map selection system that gave all maps an equal chance of being selected. For the duration of this system there were only 4 maps available (Icebox was not released until ), meaning each map had a 25% chance of being selected with no other factors taken into account. The small map pool and equal chance meant streaks of the same map were very common, resulting in 72% of players getting the same map multiple times over the course of 5 games, 26% of which would get a map streak for 3-5 of those games.VALORANT Systems Health Series - Map Diversity changed this system to be pseudo-random instead. This system would favor maps that were, on aggregate, not seen by the 10 players selected for a match, heavily punishing maps that any player had gotten a recent streak of. With the map pool still at only 4 with the introduction of this update, many players would still get map streaks at first, but as more maps were added to the pool the chances of these streaks got much lower. Once Fracture (''VALORANTs 7th map) was released, only 28% of players were getting the same map multiple times over the course of 5 games, with only 3% of which getting a map streak for 3-5 of those games. thumb||Data for map streaks a month after the deterministic system was introduced Despite these improvements, many players felt that map streaks were still too common using the pseudo-random system. Though it heavily punished maps recently played by the 10 selected players, there was still a small chance of that map being selected anyway. In order to remove the chances of these maps appearing instead, the pseudo-random system was replaced with the current deterministic system in . While it's not possible to completely prevent map streaks using the deterministic system, it was still able to further reduce the chances of players getting a map streak for 3+ games. References Navigation de:Karten es:Mapas fr:Cartes ru:Карты tr:Haritalar Category:Valorant Category:Maps Category:Loreare different types of modes that can be played in VALORANT. Most modes can be categorized as either Plant/Defuse-style or Deathmatch-style. List of Different Modes Plant/Defuse Plant/Defuse is a type of game mode where you play as an Attacker or a Defender. The Attacker's objective is to plant the spike or kill all living Defenders, while the Defender's objective is to prevent the Attacker to plant the spike (either by killing all living Attackers or preventing the Attackers from planting within the round time limit), or defuse the spike if it has already been planted (killing all living Attackers is not enough to win the round in this case). These modes are played in rounds where participants only have one life per round. Upon being killed, players must either wait for the next round to begin or be revived by Sage's to enter the battlefield again. Most Plant/Defuse modes give access to a shop, where players can spend credits to obtain weapons, shields, and abilities. Unrated thumb| Unrated is VALORANT's standard Plant/Defuse mode. Teams play 12 rounds on Attack or Defense, then swap to the other side for the next 12 rounds. The first to 13 rounds wins (Bo25), with a final Endgame round played should the game reach a 12-12 scoreline. Unrated has an estimated game time of 30-40 minutes. Swiftplay thumb| Swiftplay is a 5v5 Bo9 Plant/Defuse mode. It has most of the same gameplay rules as Unrated, but adapted for a shorter match length. Swiftplay has an estimated game time of 10-15 minutes. Competitive thumb| Competitive is a higher stakes version of Unrated where you play competitively against other players to earn and compete for a rank. Should a game reach a 12-12 scoreline, the games instead goes into Overtime where the first team to get a 2-round lead on their opponent wins the game. Players can vote every two rounds on whether to continue Overtime, which can result in the game ending in a draw should enough players vote for this option. Competitive has an estimated game time of 30-40 minutes, with the potential to go on for longer due to Overtime. Premier thumb| Premier is a tournament mode currently in beta that uses the same in-game rules as Competitive, but with a focus on top-tier competition and playing together as one squad throughout a tournament structure, including additional features taken from pro play such as map pick/ban phases. Premier matches have an estimated game time of 30-40 minutes, with the potential to go on for slightly longer due to Overtime, though Overtime in Premier is limited to a maximum of 5 additional rounds. Replication thumb| Replication is a 5v5 Bo9 mode where all players on a team play as the same agent. Players vote for an agent they want to play and the game then randomly selects one of the choices. Replication has an estimated game time of 10-15 minutes. This mode is currently unavailable to be played through either matchmaking or customs. Spike Rush thumb| Spike Rush is a Bo7 5v5 mode where all players start each round with the same random weapon. Random orbs spawn around the map that players can collect to grant buff for themselves and/or their teammates or afflict enemies with debuffs. Spike Rush has an estimated game time of 8-12 minutes. New Map When a new map is released, a separate game mode named after the map would be available to play that specific map only. This game mode is available for a short time period (usually one week) before it is removed. This mode is a 5v5 Plant/Defuse mode that can alternate between game mode styles. Prior to the release of Swiftplay, it was best-of-25 (same rules as Unrated) With the release of Swiftplay, it was changed to best-of-9 (same rules as the game mode), It went back to best-of-25 during the release of Abyss. Due to a technical issue, it was best-of-9 format during its initial release.X (formerly Twitter) post by @VALORANT: "📢Calling all Abyss explorers 📢 Due to a technical issue with the Abyss-only queue, we are temporarily changing the format to swiftplay. We'll let you know when we have a fix and the queue returns to unrated." On June 13th, 2024, a hotfix patch was deployed and it went back to best-of-25 format.X (formerly Twitter) post by @Altombre: "We have a hotfix coming to PC very soon to address the following issues..." +New map releasesBest-of-25Best-of-9Breeze Fracture Pearl AbyssLotus Sunset Deathmatch Deathmatch is a type of game mode where the objective is tied in some way to killing enemies. These modes can either be free-for-all or team based. Players have an infinite amount of lives and upon being killed will respawn at a random location after a short delay. Deathmatch thumb| Deathmatch is a 12-player free-for-all game mode designed to allow players to hone their gunplay mechanics without abilities or warm up before playing Competitive. Players equip weapons of their choice and kill anyone in their way until either a player reaches 40 kills or 9 minutes have passed, at which point the game will end. Deathmatch has an estimated game time of 7-9 minutes, with a maximum gameplay duration of 9 minutes. Escalation thumb| Escalation is a 5v5 team deathmatch mode where players kill and race the enemy team through a cycle of different weapons and abilities, advancing together as a team through Escalation levels. The first team to finish level 12, or the furthest along in 10 minutes, wins the game. Each level has a specific weapon or ability that the player is equipped with. Killing enemies grants points for the team that help to advance levels. Escalation has an estimated game time of 7–9 minutes. Snowball Fight thumb| Snowball Fight is a 5v5 team deathmatch mode where the first team to 50 kills wins. All players only have access to a Snowball Launcher that fires lethal projectile-based snowballs. Gifts also appear on the map that contain temporary power ups for the player. These can increase the launcher's rate of fire, increase snowball size, let snowballs ricochet, or increase the player's movement speed and max jump height. Snowball Fight has an estimated game time of 5-7 minutes. This mode is currently unavailable to be played through either matchmaking or customs. Team Deathmatch thumb| Team Deathmatch is a 5v5 team deathmatch mode where the first team to 100 kills wins. Players choose their loadouts based on the stage their team is at. Abilities regenerate over time instead of purchasing them with creds. There are Weapon Spawners throughout the map that give you weapons different from your loadout. Recovery Orbs appear throughout the map that recover the team's health and shield. Ultimate Orbs also appear to charge up a percentage of your Ultimate. Team Deathmatch has an estimated game time of 8-10 minutes, with a maximum gameplay duration of 9 minutes 30 seconds. Custom Game Custom Games can be created to invite specific players to the lobby from their friends list. The party leader can configure the settings of the lobby, such as choosing the desired game mode and the map for the match. A lobby can only have 10 participating players (including Deathmatch) and 2 observers (which can be expanded using Tournament Mode setting). All participating players can leave the game at anytime without penalties, but will not be able to rejoin the current match. No XP will be awarded and Dailies and Missions will not progress for all participating players. The party leader can also enable the following custom game options: OptionsFunctionsAllow CheatsAllows all players in lobby to use methods that are not available during normal play. Cheats can be accessed by pressing ESC, then to Cheats on the top side of the menu bar. Cheats are not available in Deathmatch and Escalation.

Rotating Game Mode Queue The Rotating Game Mode (RGM) queue was a feature introduced in 2.09 by Riot intended to prevent the dilution of the player base across VALORANT'''s more casual modes and the large increase of queue times it could cause. The RGM queue would cycle through these modes (Replication, Escalation, and Snowball Fight) so that only one was available at a time. For most of the time it was operational, the queue alternated between Escalation and Replication around every two weeks, with Snowball Fight occasionally making select appearances.Update on VALORANT Modes rotation The RGM queue was effectively retired in 4.08 when Escalation and Replication became simultaneously available to play. Defunct These game modes are no longer available, and they are essentially replaced with the Basic Training mode. Practice Game Modes Practice Game Modes are a series of modes that you can play in the Range. These series of modes will let you have a taste of how VALORANT'' games will work. Despite these options provided on the menu, the Range can still be explored freely. Spike Planting Upon starting the spike planting scenario, the player can purchase their necessary equipment in the buy menu, and the spike will be placed at the entrance. When the player passes through the green line, the scenario starts with enemy bots spawning. The player can stop this scenario anytime by pressing F3or exiting the spike planting scenario by shooting the check box. The player can modify the difficulty and ammo limit by pressing F3before starting the scenario. Spike Defuse Upon starting the spike defuse scenario, the player can purchase their necessary equipment in the buy menu. When the player passes through the green line, the scenario starts with enemy bots spawning, and the spike timer immediately starts counting down. The player can stop this scenario anytime by pressing F3 or exiting the spike defuse scenario by shooting the check box. The player can modify the difficulty and ammo limit by pressing F3before starting the scenario. References de:Spielmodi es:Modos de juego ru:Режимы tr:Oyun Modları Category:Valorant *The following is a glossary of the used throughout VALORANT. __TOC__ Official Terminology Official Terminology consists of terms used within VALORANT itself: Accessories: An umbrella term for cosmetic types that covers player cards, sprays, buddies, and player titles. Ace: A type of round outcome where one player on the winning team killed each enemy player at least once. Often synonymous with a pentakill. If the enemy Sage ults, the player can still get an ace with 5 kills as long as each enemy player was killed once. Team Ace: A type of round outcome where each player on the winning team killed a different enemy player. In a typical 5v5, this means all allied players need exactly 1 kill. Armory: The menu where players buy their guns, abilities, and shields Clutch: A type of round outcome where the round was won by the last player alive on the team. Flawless: A type of round outcome where no one on the winning team died. Orbs: Spherical objects that can be picked up after a short channel time to charge a point in your Ultimate ability in standard gameplay or equip the player with a buff in Spike Rush. Remake: A surrender due to unfair circumstances towards the team with disconnected or missing player(s) on Round 1. The team (excluding parties of five) can initiate a remake by typing /remake in chat on Round 2 to vote. This requires a unanimous vote within the team. This does not affect any MMR gains or losses for affected players in the lobby. Shields: Protective items that absorb a percentage of incoming damage Spike: A bomb-like device that agents plant/defuse in order to win rounds. Thrifty: A type of round outcome where the winning team won while possessing loadouts of at least an average of 2,500 less credit value than the enemy team's. Ult: Shorthand for Ultimate ability. Map Terminology Map Terminology consists of terms used to describe parts of the maps, usually used as callouts. These are often combined with spike-site letters or Attacker/Defender to refer to which specific place on the map you are indicating i.e. for a map with two Long sections where each one leads to a separate spike site, "A Long" and "B Long" can be used to distinguish between the two. Back/Back site: The parts of a spike site that are closest to Defender Spawn or the furthest parts of a site from an attacker's perspective. Cubby: A deep corner or recessed section of a passageway that players can hide in and peek from. Elbow: A tight location on a map that contains two or three 90-degree angles. Heaven: A high location from which snipers and other long-ranged weapons are usually used. Hell: A low location underneath another part of the map, usually below places regarded as "Heaven". Link: A short passageway that serves as a connector between two large sections of the map, such as 'Mid to B Defender Side' or 'B Site to C Site'. Lobby: A generic quadrilateral area close to the Attacker Spawn, often used when the area doesn't have distinguishable features to give it a more specific callout. Long: A long passageway/pathway or the longer of two pathways leading from the attacker side of the map to the site. Main: A section of neutral ground situated between a spike site and Attacker Spawn, kept out of bounds behind the barriers before a round starts. Mid: The middle section of the map. Short: A short passageway/pathway or the shorter of two pathways leading from the attacker side of the map to the site. Spawn: Refers to the starting location where players spawn at the beginning of a round. Community Terminology Community Terminology consists of terms created by the playerbase to facilitate quick and efficient communication. As well as the terms listed below, terminology referring to abilities and wiki pages dedicated to them can also be found here. ADS: Meaning "Aiming Down Sights", referring to when you use Alternate Fire on a weapon to directly look down the gun's sights. This zooms in slightly and can reduce spread and recoil, though often at the cost of reduced fire rate. Anchor: To play on a site as a defender so as to stall a push by the attackers, to buy time to allow teammates to rotate to the site to help defend. Angles: A corner of the map where a player who wants to move past has to risk putting themselves in danger in case an enemy is around the corner and waiting to get a kill before the player can stop moving and fire back. Angle advantage: A player further away from an angle has better angle advantage than someone closer to it on the opposite side due to the closer player's model becoming visible as they peek before they are able to see the further player's model themselves. Anti-eco: Refers to buying weapons to try to keep an economic lead over a team that is resorting to saving creds in an eco-round. Typically avoiding weapons that avoid close quarters combat since a team that is having an eco-round will have to resort to cheaper, close range weapons such as shotguns, SMGs and pistols. Anti-flash: A tactic that has a player take cover from where they expect an enemy to use a flash, then swing out after it is detonated to take out any enemies attempting to play off of the flash. (Agent Name) (minus Damage dealt): Usually said after you damage an enemy but they kill you first. It's to give your team the heads-up that you did damage to an agent. Example: Jett -120 Baiting: Allowing a teammate to enter a entry-frag without the intent to trade for them in the event that they are killed by an opponent. This usually wastes the entry-fragger's utility and info gained as the opponent can reposition/ recover without being punished/refragged/traded, thus leaving the team at a disadvantage. Baiting Utility: Forcing opponents to use their abilities in order to get an advantage. Bottom frag: The player with the least amount of kills on a team or for the match. Bunnyhop/B-Hop: An advanced technique that allows you to mix up your movement and move slightly faster than sprinting by timing your jumps and air strafing. Callout: Refers to indicating a place on a map by a particular name, such as “Heaven”, or “Elbow”. Camp: To defensively hold an area, usually a close angle, for a long time for an enemy to move past rather than seeking them out. Clearing angles: To check whether an opponent is around the corner or in a particular corner. Clearing site: When the attackers thoroughly check the site before planting the spike to decrease the chance of a hidden defender sneaking upon them. Clone: Usually referred to Yoru's Fakeout. Counterstrafe: An movement technique that allows you to shoot accurately if you simultaneously fire when you strafe in the opposite direction. This is achieved by firing at the moment the player has decelerated to a standstill before their movement switches to the opposite direction. Collateral: Killing more than one enemy with a single bullet. Mostly associated with high damage semi-automatic weapons e.g Sheriff, Operator. Crosshair placement: Where a player positions their crosshair as they move across the map or hold angles. Good crosshair placement keeps it in the most likely position that an opponent's head will appear in so that they can be shot and killed in as little time as possible. Crossfire: When two teammates position and fire so they are on opposite sides of an enemy between them. Crouch Spraying: An act of peeking out, and immediately crouching and spraying down the enemy. CT: Meaning "Counter Terrorists", an equivalent to VALORANT defenders brought over by Counter Strike: Global Offensive players. Default Plant: The most common location on site where the spike is planted. Default: When you're on the attacking side and your team plays a neutral/non-committal strategy to gain information and/or look for picks. Dink: Refers to a headshot that doesn’t kill an enemy, usually used to indicate that the target is close to dying. Double Swing: Two players swinging at once in order to overwhelm an opponent and force them to decide which player to shoot at usually ending in a trade. Dog: Usually referred to Skye's Trailblazer or Fade's Prowler (despite the fact that both of their abilities belong in the cat category). Dry Peek: Peeking an angle without using any abilities. Eco/eco round: When a team chooses to save credits in order to have the ability to full buy during the following round and to destabilize the opponents' economy. Entry fragger: The player or agent who looks to initiate the fight when attacking by entering first and getting the opening kill and gaining information about the opponent's positions. Exit frag: Before a bomb detonates, players will often run away so they can survive and save their guns. Looking for exit frags means to position yourself so you can kill these players rather than trying to defuse. Fake Defuse: Pretending to defuse the spike in order to force the attackers to peek to attempt to defend the spike from being defused. Faking: Pretending to attack a site in order to force defenders to rotate away from other sites allowing attackers to easily take the undefended site. Fake Clone: When a Yoru tries to fool the enemy team into thinking they are a Fakeout clone when they are not. High Risk, high reward if done correctly. Flank: When a player sneaks around to attack the enemy team from behind. Flick: To quickly move your crosshair and shoot, usually made in instant response to spotting an enemy who's position isn't currently that close to where your crosshair is positioned. Force buy: Buying the best possible weapons while lacking enough creds for a full-buy to hold onto a lead, the half is close to ending, gain an economic advantage or to increase the odds of winning a round to stave off a loss when the opponents are close to victory. Frag: Alternative term for a kill. Full-buy: When your team is able to buy to be fully equipped. Usually a combination of heavy shields and a rifle. Game sense: A player's intuitive ability to predict the positions and actions of opponents given the current gamestate. Half-buy: Buying the best equipment possible while maintaining enough creds to full-buy in the next round. Hip Fire: Firing from the hip, or without using ADS. Holding angles: When a player watches and aims at a corner of the map in anticipation of any enemies who want to peek around it. Instalock: When an ally immediately selects and locks in their agent choice when they enter agent select. Often associated with players who pick Duelists due to their popularity.

Profile Biography Biography = Zyanya Mondragón is a Radiant from Mexico with the power to absorb life energy from the souls of people that she kills. After being affected by a disastrous event involving machines, Mondragón has a strong dislike for technology and humanity, believing herself and her fellow radiants to be the true future for Alpha Earth. Before her time as a VALORANT Protocol agent, she set up a sanctuary to help people escape from Kingdom and heal, establishing a community there and becoming their protector and avenger. None of them however hold the same place in her heart as her little sister, Lucia, someone who Mondragón has been close to losing. After her eventual recruitment into VALORANT as its eleventh recruit, "Reyna", she was able to work with some of the organization's scientists to set up a procedure that allowed her to transfer some of the life energy she collects into Lucia, keeping her alive - at least for now. With the process remaining inefficient and Lucia's fate still uncertain, Reyna continues to hunt down any enemies she finds in her way, gaining more life energy with every kill and more time bought for her sister. Reyna's aggressive, bitter nature however draws concern from some of her fellow agents, and some fear what she could end up becoming should she be unable to save Lucia... |-| Timeline of events = ZYANYA MONDRAGÓN: Early Life Mondragón sets up a sanctuary to help people escape from Kingdom activities in the area.VALORANT Protocol#The Blackmailer's agent dossiers Mondragón is affected by a disastrous event involving machines, setting her on her path of hatred towards technology.Reyna quote recalling her past REYNA: VALORANT agent Recruited as its eleventh agent.

Always ambitious in her work, Killjoy has shamelessly admitted that she has a history of exploiting tech-related missions in order to "weasel more money" out of the Protocol's quarterly budget. While she describes herself as "cool as a cucumber," Killjoy grows frustration whenever she sees her teammates not participating alongside her requests such as testing new tech or reading the data reports she has written. Nevertheless, she is fully confident in her own genius, as seen when she tells her teammates (particularly the tech users) to entrust their gadgets for her to fix, and when she reminds the team to leave the overthinking to her. A glimpse of her sympathetic nature was shown in a voicemail sent to Brimstone wherein she expressed sadness over the loss of non-military lives following the destruction of the Everett-Linde Laboratory. Appearance Killjoy is a young German woman with slick dark brown hair and brown eyes. She is often seen wearing a padded yellow jacket with a blue interior, purple "X" patches on either shoulder and a green beanie-like hat. Underneath the jacket she wears a gray shirt with a rising bars graphic. She has round glasses with black outlines, a pair of silver hoop earrings in either ear, and a pair of green shoes that resemble Converse Chuck Taylor's with silver toes and loose tongues. Covering her hands are a pair of black gloves with blue straps that exposes her ring and pinkie fingers. She wears black ripped skinny jeans with a green strap on her left thigh which is also connected to a fanny pack. In "WARM-UP," Killjoy is seen wearing a white hoodie jacket with a logo of a frog mascot, and a yellow variation of her beanie.

Whilst unable to do so in game for gameplay/balancing reasons, the turret is able to move and run on its two legs. She and Raze developed the training robot known as Max Bot, who was designed to imitate and replicate the powers and skills of his opponent. If Killjoy successfully defuses a spike, her voiceline suggests that she may have something to do with its creation."Oh, no no, you don't deserve my inventions!"'' This is likely referring to her Omega counterpart, as it is the VALORANT Legion who have been the primary aggressors in the conflict between Alpha Earth and Omega Earth.

Resisting from Sawn Rocks to Kangaroo Valley, her efforts against Kingdom earned her the title of the "Great Reclaimer". Later approached by the VALORANT Protocol to become an agent, Foster was initially unsure of joining as she didn't want to give up her fight against Kingdom and leave her homeland unprotected. However, when Sage decided to contact and direct her to a massive rift in the sky near her home, telling her there were many more like that one across the world, Kirra realized that the fight was bigger than just her home territory. Finally answering the call, she now serves as the Protocol's fourteenth agent, "Skye". |-| Timeline of events = KIRRA FOSTER: Early Life Foster comes from Nimbin, New South Wales, Australia.VALORANT Lore Discord AMA: Skye's origin Foster spends years fighting against Kingdom Corporation’s activities in Nimbin, the Blue Mountains, South Coast, Sawn Rocks, and Kangaroo Valley.VALORANT Protocol#The Blackmailer's agent dossiers Foster is contacted by Sage about becoming a VALORANT Protocol agent.Skye Reveal Trailer Foster initially doesn't want to leave her home unprotected, but when shown a massive rift in the sky near her home and told that there were many more like that one across the world, she realizes that the fight was bigger than just her home territory and finally accepts.Reddit Narrative AMA: Skye's recruitment into VALORANT SKYE: VALORANT agent Recruited as its fourteenth agent First ventures into Omega Skye is assigned to keep track of a REALM convoy that is pursuing Varun Batra.5.05 Skye Voicemail Whilst in the mangroves of Southern Asia, she comes across a spot where there was a fire fight between Batra and REALM.

With her affinity to feel and sense the natural world and everything else around her, Skye is naturally observant, and will quickly note whenever she senses something unusual with her surroundings. Naturally a hard worker due to growing up in a farm, Skye seems to want to influence her teammates to be the same, as she apparently holds a woodworking class by the mess hall of their headquarters to practice having nimble minds through nimble hands, and those she catches slacking off has to join her morning run which begins at 4 in the morning.

She wears long cargo pants with kneepads, as well as boots, and wears a utility belt and a pouch located on her left leg. She also has two leaf pendants hanging from the bead necklace around her neck, contrasting with her green and nature-themed design.

Profile Biography Biography = A radiant from Tokyo, Japan, Kiritani Ryo (Japanese: 桐谷 諒) is a man dedicated to uncovering his past. Specifically interested in his ancestors and an ancient order of samurai, Kiritani's search has kept on bringing him to Kingdom's S22 container port. On his first visit, he broke into the facility and stole a mask from a set of samurai armor that allowed him to see into another dimension. He was later recruited by the VALORANT Protocol as its fifteenth agent, "Yoru", and shortly after this his familiarity with S22 saw him returning there on assignment to prevent a spike detonation by hostiles from Omega Earth.Reddit Narrative AMA: Yoru's interest in the samuraiYoru Lore Instagram Quiz Still not done with S22 however, Yoru continued to return to the site despite having other missions to do for the Protocol and against the advice of his superiors. His research led him to discovering new information relating to both radianite and the alternate dimension that he could access and enter with his powers. Finding a part of the ship with older dimensional fabric, Yoru suddenly fell through into a space that felt as if he was traveling from "now to then". He pushed forward as far as he could and heard a woman's voice calling out to him, one he thought he recognized, but before he could answer back, the rift closed. Left with even more questions, Yoru continues his research whilst serving as an agent of VALORANT, and hopes one day the Protocol's leadership will see the value in looking into these events along with him. |-| Timeline of events = KIRITANI RYO: Early Life Kiritani comes from Tokyo, Japan.VALORANT Lore Quiz - Yoru's Hometown (Discord Image) Kiritani has links to Yokohama and Ito.VALORANT Protocol#The Blackmailer's agent dossiers Kiritani travels to S22.Icebox Yoru teasers He breaks into a research room and takes a mask from a set of samurai armor being studied there. YORU: VALORANT agent Recruited as its fifteenth agent. Yoru is assigned as a member of the S22 strike team.RETAKEReddit Narrative AMA: Yoru joining the VP Yoru attempts to riftwalk into position as the hostiles try to fall back from a planted spike but is forced to reveal himself in order to save his fellow agent, Phoenix, from being eliminated by Ω-Cypher. He is able to shoot Ω-Cypher and then draw Ω-Jett towards him, leaving only Ω-Viper to deal with Phoenix. Yoru and Ω-Jett fight over the planted spike, with Yoru eventually outmaneuvering Ω-Jett to incapacitate her and allow him to defuse the spike. He eventually finishes off Ω-Jett when she picks herself up and shoots Phoenix, with Yoru hitting her by shooting through Phoenix’s body. The Omega Project Yoru is present during the Max Bot training exercise at VALORANT HQ.WARM UP Yoru remains outside the training area winning large amounts of credits from Jett in several bets that Max Bot will win every fight he is in. All his winnings are eventually confiscated by Sage after most of the agents finally defeated Max Bot as one large team. Return to S22 Yoru returns to S22 despite being told by Brimstone to leave the site alone.4.0 Yoru voicemail His continued research there reveals there is dimensional scarring on the sides of an old Japanese warship there and that the ancient armor there is filled with radianite, despite claims that it had only been discovered 10 years ago. He then finds a part of the warship where the dimensional fabric was weaker and older, falling into rift through a space that didn’t feel like he was traveling to just a new place, but a new place in time.4.02 Yoru voicemail In the rift, he also hears someone calling to him, someone he thought he knew. Yoru tries to push forward but doesn’t have time to answer the voice before the rift closes. First ventures into Omega Yoru contacts Brimstone to ask if he can borrow the American's socket wrench for use on his HX20 motorbike.5.01 Yoru Voicemail Yoru comments on the search for Varun Batra and the world's reaction to REALM's failed attempts to apprehend him.5.05 Yoru Email Journey into the City of Flowers Yoru takes time away in Salvador, Brazil, with some of the other agents before the Protocol's main mission to the City of Flowers.Salvador Vacation Twitter posts Scions of Hourglass Yoru is assigned to the Jan Mayen mission's Team 2.9.0 Yoru voicemail He takes interest in one of the blades stored in the facility's vaults, and after checking with Killjoy he decides to take it for himself. Yoru is assigned as a member of the Seoul strike team.ALL PATHS END HERE Personality Yoru is undeniably arrogant, and is known to be easily annoyed and irritated by people, including his own teammates. He operates mostly as a lone wolf, preferring to take down entire enemy teams on his own and has initially shown to cooperate with his team only out of reluctance, but over time he would go on to be a team player. Being the powerful rift walker that he is, Yoru thinks quite highly of himself and his abilities, always looking down on his enemies and referring to them as "minnows" - nothing more than small fish. Such thoughts have also been seen in action, being able to put down up to twenty enemies at once all on his own. Though some of these actions are seen as heroic by passers-by when used to bring order to the streets, Yoru himself dislikes being considered a savior or a hero for what he does. While he is irritable, he is not hotheaded nor is he impatient. In fact, his powers compel him to think strategically as he moves behind enemy lines unseen, and he takes his time with moving into position so as to ensure that he takes down his opponents perfectly. This was seen in "RETAKE," wherein he fended off Omega agents in Bennett Island with more awareness as opposed to Phoenix's blind rush towards the enemy. Appearance Yoru has spiked hair with two shades of blue, one light and the other being much darker. He sports a black ear piercing on the lobe of either ear, and he has a slit on his left eyebrow. The most notable part of his uniform is his unique blue jacket that has two spikes on both shoulders, an orange insignia depicting a skull imprinted on the shoulders, and his logo that bears resemblance to a wolf embedded on the back. He also wears black pants and a pair of black shoes. When Yoru activates his ultimate ability, he dons a samurai mask that bears an illustration of a mouth with two fangs.

Profile Biography Biography = Hailing from Accra, Ghana, Efia Danso is a Radiant with powers relating to cosmic energies, contained by a golden Guardian gauntlet. She uses these in her role as an astral guardian, ensuring that any universe-altering events do not have major consequences. Recruited by the VALORANT Protocol as its sixteenth agent, "Astra", she continues to serve as an astral guardian in between her missions for the VP, though at times her two roles have come together. When the Protocol was keeping track of the fugitive Varun Batra whilst he was on the run from his former employer in Southern Asia, Astra discovered Batra was also in possession of a Guardian artifact, a set of five rings and a bracelet. Further compelled to bring him in, the VP was able to rescue and subsequently recruit Batra as agent "Harbor". With access to the bracelet, Astra was able to deduce from engravings left on it that it could function as a key to a lost Guardian city that she had never been able to find in her time as a Guardian. To her surprise however, Harbor revealed he had found it before; the "City of Flowers" was located in the Western Ghats of India, but Harbor had arrived there only to find it decimated and sabotaged. Still hoping to salvage something from this situation, Astra's attention turned to Omega and the possibility for a counterpart of the city to also exist there. Further research revealed that it did indeed exist, but the Protocol wasn't the only group interested in it - so were their Omega counterparts, the VALORANT Legion, and with their motives unknown and Alpha's city in ruins, the possibility of Legion powering up their own city posed a catastrophic threat to millions of α-Indians. Together with Harbor and Skye, Astra crossed over to Omega to make the long journey from Lisbon to Southern India, all the while being pursued by Omega security forces. When they eventually arrived, the found Legion had gotten there first and was preparing to power up the city. Astra could only get a brief look around before the team needed to disable the city's ability to be powered up and then retreat from the site. Having been able to prevent the worst for Alpha but unable to access the city under the control of Legion and Omega security, Astra still has much to learn about the Guardians and their history. |-| Timeline of events= EFIA DANSO: Early Life Danso comes from Accra, Ghana.Instagram Astra Lore Quiz Danso journeys to a million-year-old crater containing a lake.VALORANT Protocol#The Blackmailer's agent dossiers Danso becomes an "astral guardian".Astra Astral Guardian quote ASTRA: VALORANT agent Recruited as its sixteenth agent.

She has a discussion with Harbor about his bracelet and the City of Flowers, confirming to him that his bracelet is a creation of the Guardians. She believes it to be a key they can use to activate the city on Alpha, but Harbor reveals to her his previous search for the city and the ruins he found there instead.Research Wing Recording Speculation then turns to what would happen if the city on Omega was activated instead, which they decide to investigate along with Killjoy. The trio conclude the Omega city is a multiverse nexus, but without its Alpha counterpart standing, activating it could have a catastrophic effect on Alpha that would cause millions to die.5.09 Harbor voicemail Astra is assigned to travel to Omega and go to its City of Flowers.

She is fairly straightforward when it comes to expressing herself and friendly banter is definitely her go-to style. She seems to have an affinity for liveliness, and doesn't like it when people and places have no 'color' or 'personality' to them. She has stated that her plans and ideas may sometimes sound irrational, but this is only because she can see what most cannot due to her cosmic powers. Appearance Astra is of Ghanaian descent and has a dark skin tone. Her hair, which sports a braided mohawk style, is adorned with multiple gold beads that match with more golden jewelry as a nose ring, multiple earrings on her left ear, and a pair of big hoops. Astra's outfit comprises of bright blues, purples, and gold incorporating native designs from her culture. She wears a small, purple hooded shawl, and she pulls up the hood when she is in her Astral Form. She wears a blue shirt alongside a brown sleeveless vest, donning a mechanical golden arm on the left side of her person, while her right arm is exposed with a gold bracelet on her wrist and her hand is covered by a fingerless purple glove. She wears a pair of purple jeans with metallic kneecaps, with shoes of the same color.

Profile Biography Biography= The Frenchman Vincent Fabron lives his life in search of one necessary goal, willing to sacrifice anything that gets in his way of achieving it. He has spent much of his time involved with combat and weapons, having worked for the French military before becoming a PMC marksman and then a weapons designer for Kingdom Defense. His employment at Kingdom was only a stepping stone for him though, as by this point he was already set on his path in pursuit of his sacred truth. One such event that exemplified Fabron's will to continue with his goals no matter the cost surrounds his actions at the Everett-Linde Research Facility in Santa Fe County, New Mexico, where he traveled to around 9 AFL and began communicating with employees there. Fabron soon found himself barred from entering facility grounds shortly after attempting to access their systems but eventually returned to reinstate his security clearance and obtain schematics. However, he was soon forced to make a decision that required him to destroy the facility's Large Radian Collider. Having already made contact with his Omega counterpart, together they fired on the LRC on the day the lab's people were celebrating its supposed success. The resulting explosion killed many of its employees and the facility was reduced to a husk. Not long after the events of Everett-Linde, Fabron encountered senior VALORANT Protocol agents Brimstone and Viper, where together they were put in an unpleasant situation. After promoting himself as someone who could help VALORANT out with their Omega Project, the Protocol's leadership gave Fabron a position as their eighteenth agent. Becoming "Chamber", he immediately proved himself to be a necessary asset to the VP's goals, providing blueprints necessary to properly construct an Alpha-Omega teleporter, as well as helping with its power issues by recommending a prospective agent with radiant abilities that could help. Even with his new partnership with the VALORANT Protocol though, Chamber's necessary goal still remains to be achieved. With some of his fellow agents (including some of Earth's most skilled investigators and devoted defenders) already having their suspicions about his motives, Chamber has to tread more carefully than ever before if he is to reach his final objective - and be prepared for judgement when the truth of his character is revealed as a result. |-| Timeline of events = VINCENT FABRON: Early Life Fabron has links to Saint-Étienne and an organization called Culverin.VALORANT Protocol#The Blackmailer's agent dossiers Fabron works for the French military as a PMC marksman.3.10 Cypher email Fabron works for Kingdom Defense as a weapons designer.

He sets high standards for himself and his team, reminding everyone that if they were to secure victories, they might as well go all-out and be the best in what they do. He has shown friendliness with many of the agents in the Protocol, but he is very much aware that he holds many secrets which are better kept hidden. Appearance Chamber sports a combover hairstyle and wears a pair of glasses with a thick, rectangular frame. He is seen wearing a blue suit vest over a white long-sleeved shirt, along with a geometrical colorful midnight tie. The said vest has three rifle bullets in place of where the buttons are located. Covering his hands are a pair of brown gloves with white straps that exposes his ring and pinkie fingers. He sports a custom watch with gold straps on his left arm, and he wears a cedar pair of pants held by a belt with white straps and a buckle which sports a unique golden outline. He wears a golden chain clipped across his tie as a strap as well. On the left side of his face are several gold nanotech "tattoos", resembling traces found on a printed circuited board. These tattoos also appear on his arms and cover more of his body below his neck. It is these tattoos that form his Tour De Force; when Chamber wants to equip the rifle, the tattoos leave his body to construct it.Lore Discord AMA: Chamber's tattoosChamber's nanotech tattoos Notably, Chamber's entire suit (without his tie) turns into a gold color whenever he is within proximity of a Rendezvous anchor although it is unknown if this is purely a gameplay mechanic given that this is not the case depicted in his agent reveal trailer.

You are off the hook, as they say. Forgive me for doing your job!" Relations Chamber is one of the few VALORANT agents known to have met and conversed with his Omega counterpart. The two currently have a deal with each other, as seen with them working together in Chamber's reveal trailer and an in-game voiceline when Chamber kills his mirror. "Oh our deal? It's over. Sorry for the late notice." Despite this deal, the Chambers do not appear to completely trust each other. Omega Chamber has been seen to briefly take aim at his double, and the two seem to know that there is little trust between them. "You knew not to trust me." Chamber was recruited into the VALORANT Protocol by Brimstone and Viper, as seen in L'Accord. The encounter was not a smooth one, with Brimstone being imprisoned and had to be released by Chamber with the help of his Omega counterpart. Chamber has a past misunderstanding with Neon, which prevented him from meeting her directly in order to recruit her into the organization. Development Chamber's reveal trailer, L'Accord, is a metaphor for the major themes in Chamber's story rather than an accurate depiction of canon events.Lore Discord AMA: Canonicity of L'Accord Inspiration for the trailer was taken from opening credits sequences of iconic TV series and films.

All agents have three types of abilities to give them more tactical opportunities and assist their gunplay; basic, signature, and ultimate. Summary thumb||Sage with Slow Orb equipped. thumb||Fade suppressed by KAY/O's ZERO/point. Many abilities have to be equipped to be used, causing the agent to go through an equip animation for a short amount of time before they can cast the ability, though some can be cast instantly. Abilities are only audible to enemies after they are cast; nearby enemies cannot hear when you are equipping abilities. Players are prevented from using abilities if they are suppressed. Some abilities can affect both enemies and allies. Such abilities that damage allies deal 1/3 damage, while abilities that has debuff effects affect allies fully. Ability usage differs per game mode. In most Plant/Defuse modes (Unrated, Competitive and Swiftplay), most abilities have a cost to obtain and use (through credits or ult points), though some are given for free. In Spike Rush and Replication, all basic and signature abilities are refreshed every round. In Team Deathmatch, all basic and signature abilities are set on a cooldown, while ultimate abilties use a percentage bar depending on kills and ultimate orbs. In Deathmatch, Escalation and Snowball Fight, individual agents' ability usage are disabled. Several abilities cannot be used during Buy Phase in Plant/Defuse modes as they do not achieve anything if they were to be cast at this time, however others can be as they specifically help agents to set up utility or positioning before the Round Phase begins.

Whilst most of these interact with agents' standard abilities, these effects are often utilized by multiple of an agent's abilities instead of being a passive effect that is only part of an individual ability. Many passives do not require any active interaction from the player to be activated or applied, but there are some passive effects that do require the player to activate them with a specific hotkey.

All agents have one signature ability that will give them one free charge for them to use, with the exception of Reyna having two abilities, albeit having shared charges between them. Some agents may be able to increase the amount of charges they have of their signature ability by buying more with credits, but any regenerated charges from cooldowns will not be kept for the next round and they will restart with their one free charge. Charges that do not get used and did not get regenerated will be carried over to the next round, however a new charge will not be added. Signature abilities that don't offer the option to buy more charges have other ways to allow the player to use that ability more than once in a round (except for 's ), such as cooldowns or enemy kill targets. {| class="wikitable sortable" |+List of Signature Abilities !Agent !Ability !Cost ();per use !Max.charges !Rechargable withcooldown/kills !Functions |- | | |150 | style="text-align:center" |4 | style="text-align:center" |Stars cooldown only when Dissipate is used. |Setup |- | | | data-sort-value="0" |Free | style="text-align:center" |1 | style="text-align:center" | |Concuss |- | | |100 | style="text-align:center" |3 | style="text-align:center" | |Smoke |- | | | data-sort-value="0" |Free | style="text-align:center" |1 | style="text-align:center" | |Teleport |- | | |150 | style="text-align:center" |2 | style="text-align:center" | |Smoke |- | | | data-sort-value="0" |Free | style="text-align:center" |1 | style="text-align:center" | |Controlled Deployable |- | | | data-sort-value="0" |Free | style="text-align:center" |1 | style="text-align:center" | |Barrier |- | | | data-sort-value="0" |Free | style="text-align:center" |1 | style="text-align:center" | |Intel |- | | | data-sort-value="0" |Free | style="text-align:center" |1 | style="text-align:center" |Dizzy only rechargeable via Globules passive. |Autonomous DeployableBlind |- | | | data-sort-value="0" |Free | style="text-align:center" |1 | style="text-align:center" | |SlowWall |- | | | data-sort-value="0" |Free | style="text-align:center" |1 | style="text-align:center" |Double Tap duration refreshes upon every energy orb hit of a fallen enemy. |EmpowermentInvulnerability |- | | | data-sort-value="0" |Free | style="text-align:center" |1 | style="text-align:center" | |Dash |- | | | data-sort-value="0" |Free | style="text-align:center" |1 | style="text-align:center" | |Intel |- | | | data-sort-value="0" |Free | style="text-align:center" |1 | style="text-align:center" | |Autonomous Deployable |- | | |150 | style="text-align:center" |2 | style="text-align:center" | |Dash |- | | |150 | style="text-align:center" |2 | style="text-align:center" | |Smoke |- | | | data-sort-value="0" |Free | style="text-align:center" |1 | style="text-align:center" | |Molotov |- | | | data-sort-value="0" |Free | style="text-align:center" |1 | style="text-align:center" | |Deterrent |- | rowspan="2" | | | rowspan="2" | 200 | rowspan="2;" style="text-align:center" |2(shared charges) | rowspan="2;" style="text-align:center" | |Heal |- | |Intangibility |- | | | data-sort-value="0" |Free | style="text-align:center" | 1 | style="text-align:center" | |Heal |- | | |250 | style="text-align:center" |2 | style="text-align:center" | |Controlled DeployableFlash |- | | | data-sort-value="0" |Free | style="text-align:center" |1 | style="text-align:center" | |Intel |- | | | data-sort-value="0" |Free | style="text-align:center" |1 | style="text-align:center" |Toxic Screen's emitters remain indefinitely during the round.

To use an ultimate, players must acquire ultimate points. These are earned by killing enemies, dying, capturing ultimate orbs, and completing a spike plant or defuse. Once a player has earned enough points, they can use them up to cast their ultimate. Upon doing so, all players will hear a global voice line alerting them to that specific agent using their ultimate. Gekko is the only agent with three additional voice lines due to his ability to recast his ultimate in the same round. +List of Ultimate AbilitiesAgent AbilityCost(points)Functions7Wall9ConcussDisplacement8Deterrent8SlowWeapon Equip8IntangibilityRevive6Intel7DetainDisplacement8DecayIntel7Controlled DeployableDetain7ConcussIntel7Banish8Weapon Equip8EmpowermentRevive 9Detain7Weapon Equip7Teleport6Revive8Weapon Equip6Empowerment8Revive8Autonomous DeployableNearsightSlow8Weapon Equip 9DecayVision Blocker7Intangibility +Ultimate voice linesAgentAs anallyAs anenemy "World divided!""You are divided!""Let's go!""Off your feet!""Open up the sky!""Prepare for hellfire!""They are so dead!""You want to play?

Functions While each ability in VALORANT is unique, some share similar functions. These allow them to be sorted into the following classes and sub-classes:Barrier: Barriers prevents agents from being able to move through them.Blind: Blinds are used to limit an agent's vision.Flash: Flashes completely remove all vision.Nearsight: Nearsights afflict enemies with a short, maximum vision radius as well as deafening them.Cripple: Cripples apply temporary debuffs to an agent's health, bringing them closer to death or increasing incoming damage taken by them.Crowd Control: Crowd Control tools affect an enemy's capability to move on the map.Banish: Banish abilities remove the affected agents from the map.Concuss: Concuss abilities reduce movement speed and fire rate, decrease bullet accuracy, prevent use of scopes or ADS, and affect a player's vision.Detain: Detains severely reduce movement speed, massively decreases jump height and force the enemy to unequip all their weapons and abilities.Displacement: Displacements physically move enemies out of position by force and against their will.Slow: Slows reduce an enemy's movement speed.Tether: Tethers prevent an enemy from moving beyond a specific location.Decoy: Decoys are used to distract an enemy and draw their attention away from where the real threat is.Deterrent: Deterrents are used to flush enemies out of certain positions by threatening to kill them if they attempt to stay in that location.Molotov: Molotovs deal damage over time in a small area-of-effect on the ground of the location they detonate in.Empowerment: These increase an agent's power by buffing them in some way.Weapon Equip: Grants the agent a new weapon for them to use.Intel: Intel tools give information on the whereabouts of enemies. Autonomous deployable: Autonomous deployables operate on their own without any further input from the player.Controlled deployable: Controlled deployables must be controlled by the player to operate.Limiter: Limiters apply debuffs that disable specific parts of an agent's loadout.Mobility: Mobility tools abilities give agents a way to traverse the map beyond just running and walking.Dash: Dashes allow the user to move in a certain direction at greatly increased speed.Intangibility: These allow the user to be immune to damage. They can also grant invisibility in some circumstances, hiding them from enemy sight.Teleport: Teleports allow the user to blink to a location without having to walk or run between their start and end position.Resource Bar: Abilities that use resource bars require enough of their resource to be available in order to be cast.Setup: These abilities provide setup that the agent will use for casting some of their other abilities.Sustain: Sustain tools allow agents to withstand and counteract damage being dealt to them while remaining active on the battlefield.Heal: Heals restore health to the target.Invulnerability: These make the affected agent immune to all sources of damage.Revive: Revives allow an agent to continue fighting even after taking lethal damage.Vision Blocker: Vision blockers block line of sight, allowing allies to carry out actions behind or inside the blocking object without giving visual info to the enemy.Smoke: Smokes are spherical vision blockers.Wall': Walls are linear/rectangular vision blockers. Some abilities may be completely unique and therefore do not fit into any of these functions. Such abilities are classed as Niche, however all abilities in the game currently fit under at least one of the above classes instead. Lore The abilities used by agents in-game also make appearances within the lore of VALORANT. However, whilst gameplay must take balancing into account, the lore is not tied down by these restrictions and so more "realistic" depictions (in the context of the VALORANT'' universe) can be shown within the lore, meaning there can be some differences between how abilities operate in-game and in-universe. Gameplay does not have to be accurate to how abilities would realistically work within the lore, and lore does not have to be accurate to how abilities are required to work in-game. For example, in the case of in-universe depictions not needing to accurately reflect gameplay functionality, Killjoy's Turret must remain in one place when it is deployed in-game with just basic 'detect and engage' programming. Away from the restrictions of gameplay balancing in the lore however, the turret can be seen running alongside Killjoy and understanding and reacting to directive hand gestures. Not being restricted to the exact functionality of abilities in-game allows the lore to show these depictions that make much more sense from a narrative perspective. For the reverse case of gameplay not needing to adhere to how abilities would realistically work within the lore meanwhile, Brimstone's Sky Smokes and Orbital Strike are deployed from an orbital satellite, so from a narrative perspective targeting areas inside buildings would only cause his utility to be blocked by the roofs of these buildings instead (temporarily however in assumedly most cases for Orbital Strike until the laser cuts through, or if the roof material is weak enough for a Sky Smoke to break through on impact). In-game however, it is necessary for these abilities to immediately affect these target areas without any disruption by any terrain above, even if from a narrative perspective this would either be unrealistic or completely impossible. The needs of gameplay balancing will always come first over lore accuracy when designing in-game abilities, even if within the lore such functionality or decision making would make no sense at all. Agents also aren't restricted to just having the abilities that they have in-game within the lore, such as with Neon who has been seen to also have the ability to release a large electrical pulse from her body when in Overdrive.

It uses the same in-game rules and format as Unrated, but with a focus on higher-stakes competition. Gameplay See also: Unrated Competitive has the same gameplay rules as Unrated. In brief summary, two teams of five players select their agents. One team starts on Attack and the other on Defense. To win a round, the attacking team must kill all enemy Defenders or detonate the spike. The defending team must kill all enemy attackers, prevent the spike from being planted, or (if the spike has been planted) defuse the spike (killing all enemy attackers will no longer be enough to win the round should defusing be required). Before each round start, players have 30 seconds to buy weapons and utility, get into position, and set up any utility. Each round lasts 100 seconds, which is reset to 45 seconds if the spike is planted. The game is split into two halves; after 12 rounds, teams will swap sides. The first team to reach 13 rounds wins the game. Competitive does however have a different system for resolving 12-12 games, going into Overtime instead of Endgame. In Overtime, the teams play two rounds, one on attack and one on defense. For all players in every round, they get 5,000 credits and have their ultimate points set to being 3 short of what they need to use it. If a team wins both these rounds, they win the game. If both teams win one round each, Overtime repeats again and again until either one team wins both rounds and wins the game or the players vote to end the game with the result being a draw for both teams. Each vote will happen with every new Overtime set. To end the match in the draw, the first vote needs 6 votes in favor, the second vote needs 3 votes in favor, and every other afterwards needs only 1 vote in favor. There are slight differences with surrendering. Competitive requires a unanimous vote instead of the usual 80% from Unrated to be able to surrender. Accessing and playing Competitive Starting in Episode 04, to be able to play Competitive, players must have reached Account Level 20. Accounts that have not yet reached level 20 but have already played Competitive before 4.0 will still be able to play Competitive. Forfeited games will not count towards this requirement for the team that forfeited. Parties Players can queue into Competitive with up to five people in a stack or party, excluding parties with four players. Matchmaking takes party size into account, and will attempt to match them with opposing teams who have a similar party size. Parties of five will always match against enemies who are in parties of five as well, thus expecting queue times to be longer. In general, the ranks within a party must fit within the restriction range to be eligible to play Competitive: +Party restriction rangePlayer's rankWithin rank rangeParties of twoParties of threeParties of five|link= |link= |link=Iron|link= Iron 1 to |link= Silver 3 No restrictions|link= |link= |link=Bronze|link= |link= |link=Silver|link= Iron 1 to |link= Gold |link= |link= |link=Gold|link= Silver 1 to |link= Platinum |link= |link= |link=PlatinumExactly one tier apart|link= |link= |link=Diamond|link= |link= |link=Ascendant|link= |link= |link=ImmortalExactly one tier apart1 Cannot queue|link=RadiantNotes 1 One tier apart examples: A |link= Platinum 2 player can queue with a |link= Diamond 2 or a |link= Gold player of any tier An |link= Immortal 1 player can queue with a |link= Radiant or an |link= Ascendant 1 player A |link= Diamond 2 player cannot queue with an |link= Ascendant 3 or a |link= Platinum 1 player An |link= Ascendant 3 player cannot queue with a |link= Radiant or a |link= Diamond 2 player 2 Parties of five will be affected by reduced RR gains/losses should they meet one of these conditions: 25% reduction: if any players are outside of the usual restriction range made for parties of two and three. Example: A |link= Gold 1 player can queue with a |link= Diamond 3 and/or an |link= Iron 1 player, but the entire party of five will result in 25% RR reduction. if any players are |link= Immortal 1 to |link= Immortal 3. 75% reduction if any players are |link= Radiant. Having any players in the party that are below Radiant automatically reduces your potential RR by 90%. Players in their placement games can still join a party with already ranked players, taking into account of the player's previous Act's rank(s) to determine whether or not the player can queue with the party within the restriction range. Ranks List of Competitive RanksRankTierImageRadiantImmortalAscendantDiamondPlatinumGoldSilverBronzeIronUnranked There are 9 ranks in VALORANT; Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Ascendant, Immortal, and Radiant. Ranks Iron to Immortal are divided into three tiers from Tier 1 to Tier 3, with Tier 3 being the highest tier within a rank. Players ranked in Immortal and Radiant are featured on a leaderboard. thumb|left||An example of a target Rank Distribution for an Act The rank distribution is designed to have the average player holding a rank in Silver. Despite having target designs per act, the true distribution will never exactly fit this as the playerbase's skill is constantly shifting, though the true distribution should still be quite similar to it.Ask VALORANT - Aug. 27 To earn a rank, new players must first play 5 placement games. The highest rank a player can place after completing their placements is Ascendant 1. Rank Rating (RR) A player's position on the Competitive ladder will go up and down based on when they win or lose games, respectively. Players who perform exceptionally well in game will rank up faster than average. This will be shown to a player at the end of each game where their current rank is displayed. A Rank Rating (RR) will show how their rank has changed after the results of that game. Wins earn a player around 5-50 RR depending on rank (higher ranks usually earn less RR), and losses cost a player around 0-30 depending on rank (higher ranks lose more RR). Draws grant a maximum of 20 RR (based on performance, though only for Iron to Ascendant players). Players who reach 100 RR in a tier are promoted to the next highest tier and start at a minimum of 10 RR in that tier. Players will reach 0 RR in a tier are at risk of demoting, but only once they have lost a game whilst at 0 RR. Their given RR in the lower tier will not go below 70. Immortal and Radiant players can earn beyond 100 RR to climb up the leaderboard, and the top 500 players in each region make up the Radiant rank, so long as they pass an RR threshold (depending on region): LATAM, KR: 100 RR BR: 200 RR NA, APC: 300 RR EU: 400 RR At first, personal performance will have a greater impact on the early evaluation of a player's skill, but will decrease in importance compared to wins as they play more games in Competitive. For games that end in a draw, a player's rank may go up but it will never decrease. Dodging in a Competitive lobby will punish the player with a small RR loss. Players who are inactive (AFK) for 3+ rounds will incur a penalty of 8-12 RR, increasing the more rounds they are inactive for, in addition to any RR lost from losing the game (the total can exceed the maximum RR loss cap). Any players who are inactive for 6+ rounds will incur the maximum penalty of 12 RR, even if their team wins. Act resets For every new act, all players must play 1 placement game to earn them back their rank from the previous act, though this rank could potentially change based on the player's performance in that game. Placements don’t give progress towards earning an Act Rank. Immortal and Radiant players keep their position on the leaderboard but have their RR reduced by 90%, with all Radiant players also being demoted to Immortal. When a new act is also part of a new episode, the number of placement games required is increased to 5 and the player's rank placement will be around a couple of tiers below where the player ended the prior Act. Act Rank A player's act rank tracks their proven skill, highest ranked win, and number of wins during an act. As players win games, they fill up a triangular graphic with smaller triangles that represents their ranked match wins based on the rank they ended that game with. Once the graphic is filled, wins at higher ranks will displace triangles from lower ranks. The border surrounding this graphic also upgrades as players win more games. These upgrades occur at 9, 25, 50, 75, and 100 wins. When an act ends, the player's Act Rank is preserved as a badge seen on the player's card in Competitive games and in their career history. This badge is equal to the the top Act Rank they reached in that act. For Immortal and Radiant players, this badge will also preserve their leaderboard position for that act.

Players must obtain 9 wins in any of an Act within that Episode to be rewarded with the Buddies matching their rank. Update History Trivia A concept for Competitive ranks had different rank names; Mercenary, Soldier, Veteran, Hero, Legend, Mythic, Immortal, and VALORANT, from lowest to highest. However, this system has never been used whilst the game has been available since its Beta. Of these names, only the Immortal rank name made it into the current version. The other ranks were renamed to match a metal/gemstone system commonly used in other games, including Riot's other games. The highest rank remained VALORANT during the Beta, but was renamed to Radiant once the game was launched to avoid confusion with the game title itself. On April Fools 2021, all ranks were replaced with a Love Rank and Rank Rating was replaced with Love Rating. These were purely cosmetic changes that were displayed over a player's actual rank and RR changes for the day. In July 2020, some players were affected by a bug that caused their visual rank icon to be replaced by an "Unused" rank icon instead.Dextero: Riot responds to Valorant issue causing mysterious rank icon to appear Valorant ranks.jpg|Concept for Competitive ranks and icons TX HeartRank Large.png|2021 April Fools Love Rank TX CompetitiveTier Large 1.png|"Unused 1" icon TX CompetitiveTier Large 2.png|"Unused 2" icon References Category:Game Modesright|frameless|150x Controllers are one of the four roles that agents are divided into in VALORANT.

Profile Biography Biography = A Radiant from Türkiye, Hazal Eyletmez searches for a person of importance to her after he was 'taken from her'. Using her ability to see nightmare-visions, her interpretations initially led her to suspect that he had been kidnapped by a secret organization she found to be the VALORANT Protocol. Eyletmez decided to contact the Protocol under an anonymous mark, threatening to expose the organization if she found out they were responsible for the kidnapping. When they appeared to only have interest in tracking her down rather than take her seriously, she then contacted each agent personally with a dossier about them to show how much she knew about VALORANT's people and what she could expose to the public if they had no interest in proving their innocence. VALORANT however still refused to give in and soon sent a strike team to Istanbul to apprehend her. Eyletmez attempted to use her Radiant powers to distract them and flee undetected but was spotted just as she was making her escape, allowing the Anti-Yield robot KAY/O to jump on her position and take her down with a suppressing pulse. Subsequently detained and taken to a VP base, Eyletmez was interrogated there by senior agents. However, it was because of these direct, face-to-face meetings that a critical piece of information came to light - VALORANT had no idea who she was trying to track down and knew nothing of any kidnapping. Whoever was responsible for the man's disappearance, it wasn't the VALORANT Protocol. It was after this revelation that Eyletmez also came to learn about the existence of other worlds and it was suggested to her that maybe her unknown group came from one of these worlds instead. VALORANT themselves were already preparing to travel to one, having had to put that project on hold in order to deal with Eyletmez. Their search had also exposed how reliant the Protocol was on specific agents for information, and they were looking to recruit more as a result. With there being no more reason for the two to be enemies, VALORANT's senior agents decided to ask if she would join the organization and help them gather information during their trip to Omega Earth. Choosing to put this misunderstanding behind her, Eyletmez accepted their offer to become their twentieth agent, "Fade". She now carries the banner of the VALORANT Protocol - but only as long as it brings her closer to the person she seeks. |-| Timeline of events = HAZAL EYLETMEZ: Early life Eyletmez works for REALM as a freelancer.5.03 Fade Email A person of importance in Eyletmez's life goes missing. From her interpretations of nightmare-visions, she ends up suspecting that the VALORANT Protocol is responsible for this.From the Archives: The Sting Audio Logs Blackmailing the VALORANT Protocol Eyletmez contacts Brimstone with threats of exposing the VALORANT Protocol if they did not prove their innocence regarding the disappearance of her missing person.4.02 Blackmailer email In response to VALORANT attempting to track her down, Eyletmez sends personal dossiers to each agent, once again threatening to publicly expose the Protocol if they could not prove their innocence.4.04 Blackmailer email Eyletmez attempts to flee from a VALORANT strike team sent to Istanbul.Istanbul Mission She uses her Radiant powers to stall the Ground squad as she attempts to flee the scene but is suppressed and taken down by KAY/O. She is then taken into VALORANT’s custody for interrogation. Eyletmez is interrogated by Brimstone and Cypher. Eyletmez is reported to be affecting her surroundings using her Radiant powers during her interrogations, assumed to be attempts at intimidating her captors, which only ends up affecting other agents of the Protocol who were not even aware of her presence on site.4.07 Phoenix voicemail In one interrogation meeting with Cypher, Eyletmez reveals much of the information she has learnt about the VALORANT Protocol. When they inquire about her missing person, Fade doesn't see the point in bothering to explain the situation to the group she believes knows exactly what they had done to him. However, when Cypher denies VALORANT having any involvement, Fade asks who would be responsible if not them, at which point Cypher reveals the existence of other worlds to her.Fade interrogation audio log FADE: VALORANT agent Recruited as its twentieth agent.4.08 Fade Voicemail Fade is recruited to help VALORANT scout Omega Earth.

The Omega Project Fade is the first VALORANT agent to use the Protocol's Alpha-Omega teleporter.4.09 Fade Voicemail She arrives in a city and uses her powers to peer into the minds of its citizens. She finds out many of them are fearful and on edge, and locates a new place of interest for the VP to investigate due to the secrets it supposedly holds. First ventures into Omega Fade reports her investigation into Varun Batra, a new advisor to the VALORANT Legion, to Brimstone. Alpha Batra is discovered to be a REALM operative, so Fade decides to put Brimstone in touch with the organization. Fade is contacted by an old colleague of hers, Captain Greaves of REALM, about her inquiry into Alpha Varun Batra.5.04 Fade Email He acknowledges how long it's been since he and Fade have talked, but will only inform her that Batra is now a fugitive after he stole a priceless artifact, and warns her not to inquire further. He contacts her once more when he discovers Batra has been communicating with an unknown entity, suspecting it's her, and warns her once again to stay out of REALM affairs.5.07 Greaves Email Fade reports Batra (now recruited as twenty-first agent "Harbor") and the Protocol are in the clear after they successfully extracted him out of India.5.08 Fade Email Journey into the City of Flowers Fade has a Nightmare-vision of Alpha falling apart, its people all gripped by fear, and sees the end of their time.6.0 Fade Voicemail Soon after, she is reported to be not sleeping well, up and wandering at all hours, and appearing to be always troubled.6.01 Cypher Voicemail Project Landfall Fade has sessions with Omen to try and help him restore some of his past memories.7.07 Omen email Scions of Hourglass Fade has a Nightmare-vision about Clove, sensing that they are in danger and anticipating a connection to events occurring in Edinburgh with Omen.8.03 Fade voicemail Fade is assigned to the Jan Mayen mission's Team 2.9.0 Fade voicemail She searches the base for her missing person in the hope that he had been confined there but there is no sign of him. Fade is assigned to a strike team defending the ruins of Venice from the VALORANT Legion as part of a set of simultaneous incursions across Alpha.INCURSIONS Personality Fade's initially perceived harshness is the headliner of her personality, but she has a sense of humor, when she says something that usually is quite deadpan it's often complimented with a quick-witted joke. Working with the operation can feel like a chore to her, wanting things over and done with - often coming across as reluctant even when revived. She seems to harness a little bit of pride for her Radiant abilities and the major advantages they give her (and her team) in battle, and notes the more 'intimidating' agents aren't all what they seem, such as Reyna and Viper. She's not shy to admit when she's impressed by any of the agents - actively encouraging when they do well, so she's trying to make sure team synergy is high, and could be argued she actually wants to warm up to the agents, talking about what they can do combined. She would rather not be enemies with who she'll be working with for as long as she gets closer to finding 'him'. Fade seems to pity her mirrored self, saying she's 'seen too much', alluding to the fact that Fade might hate her powers, seeing everyone's raw trauma may help in the battlefield, but seems to bother her mentally, this may be "the price to commune with Nightmare" - she even says 'anything to keep me awake'. Appearance Fade is a lighter-skinned slim woman, with her dramatic black rectangular eyeshadow, black lipstick, dark oval marking on her face and neck and hair that transitions from black to white with the right half being short and the left half with longer strands around her face, she is given a highly grungy aesthetic. There are distinct cat-like features embedded in her design, from the heterochromia associated with the Turkish breed of Angora/Ankara 'Van' cat, paw print-like marking on her neck and the paw prints on the sole of her shoes. Even her second ability Seize has been noted to look like a ball of yarn. Along with an outfit composed of a dark blue similar to Omen's, and black accents, such as her shirt/sleeves - which are ripped, matching the gloves she wears that expose hands adorned with henna. Her blue jacket sports a Nazar or 'Evil Eye' which is a symbol of protection from misfortune in Türkiye and nearby countries, with a spiky purple collar and silver lining, her jacket is also marked with shapes in this same color. Her pants are black and dark blue, with stitched detailing on her left thigh. On her waist there is a second Nazar where her two bags are, a black one on her right thigh, and a purple one on her left hip. She has steel, capped black leather/leather-looking boots, with paw prints on the sole.

Profile Biography Biography = A former task force agent, Varun Batra is the unexpected owner of an ancient and powerful artifact with the power to control and summon masses of water out of nothing. Previously working for REALM to recover such sorts of items from the black market and return them to their rightful owners, Batra was regarded as a kind-hearted man but also a deadly force to deal with in combat. His dedication to the cause through years of service fighting criminals earned him a reputation as a hero and a legend. That all changed with one mission to Mumbai. The artifact REALM had sent his team to retrieve this time would be unlike anything the task force has dealt with before, even for their line of work. When he finally came across the room holding the relic, Batra discovered a pedestal in the shape of a hand, bearing five rings and a bracelet. Upon entering the room by himself, the artifact began to activate, becoming drawn to Batra, detaching from its pedestal, and attaching to his hands instead. Batra could tell it held immense power - and he wasn't the only one. He turned around to find one of his colleagues, Greaves, was holding him at gunpoint, demanding that he hand the artifact over so he could take it himself for a secret, rogue faction that had been operating within REALM. As Batra stood his ground in defiance, Greaves opened fire and the bracelet activated, summoning a wall of water between the two men that blocked the bullets from passing through. When the wall dissipated, Batra had fled and Greaves was left in an empty room. Not wanting Batra to ever get the opportunity to report to the rest of REALM what he had tried to do, Greaves framed Batra for intentionally stealing the relic and trying to kill the captain in the process. Using this fabricated story and his rank in the force, Greaves sent convoys out after Batra with the specific order to kill Batra rather than just capture him, forcing him to go on the run throughout southern Asia. With the powers of the bracelet now attached to him though, Batra was more than capable of keeping himself safe from however many men REALM sent to eliminate him, being able to summon shields and walls of water to protect himself and sweep his enemies away. After almost two months of being pursued by REALM, a lifeline arrived in the form of the VALORANT Protocol, who appeared to have a peculiar interest in him specifically. Batra agreed to an extraction and was picked up by the organization, allowing him to escape from REALM's manhunt for good. With his recruitment into the VP, Batra became its twenty-first agent, "Harbor". Now, he has a new mission in a very different conflict, as the Protocol seeks answers behind the powers and origins of his bracelet, and what their adversaries from Omega might be using it for. |-| Timeline of events = VARUN BATRA: Early Life Batra works for REALM.REALM conversation He gains a big reputation as a "legend" and "hero" of the task force.

He has shown to be an individual with considerable experience in combat, coming from his extended period of time serving under REALM, wherein he built a reputation of being an exemplary soldier worthy of being deemed as a legend. Outside of being an operative, Harbor has also built a reputation of being the "nicest guy you'll ever meet" - assuming you're on the same side as him. However, when the time comes for Harbor to be assigned on a mission, those who worked alongside him will tell about how he is an "absolute terror out on the field." An accomplished historian and antiquarian, Harbor is never shy to proclaim his knowledge and fascination about the worlds of ancient artifacts, history, and architecture. He seems to enjoy his job of working with historical relics and structures. Assign him anywhere in the world, and he just might be able to share a tidbit of his current location's history. Appearance Harbor has a dark brown complexion, with matching brown eyes, a full brown beard, and long, dark hair sporting a bun. Visibly having a well-toned body, he has elaborate tattoos on his arms, with the right one having an intricate and repeating triangular pattern, and the left bearing the logo of REALM. Harbor's clothing primarily features a green/teal color. His jacket is on the greener side, with a popped collar that shows a blue floral design underneath. His pants are a lighter blue, with several pockets and belts. Hanging around his neck is a single broken dog tag, with what looks to be a computer chip hanging out of the other end. Harbor's left arm also has his Bracelet latched on around the wrist, forming a golden circular band with a gilded blue orb on the top. While usually dormant and collapsed, the Bracelet expands into its 'activated' form when channeling his powers, with the band rotating around his wrist and the orb spinning in place. The 5 rings that he uses in conjunction with the bracelet are dispersed among his fingers, with two on the left hand and three on the right.

The match was the first domino to fall in a 3-2 start to the season that saw the rookie VCT organization miss out on Masters Madrid . As a result, G2 shuffled their roster, replacing one of the members from their Ascension-winning squad.Five months later, in a blockbuster move now looking to build on a roster that's become one of the region's strongest, G2 Esports upgrade a duelist position that has been shaky as of late.In their maiden year in the VCT, G2 took the Americas region by storm.

They would prove themself as a prominent force internationally, being one of the few teams outside of North America and EMEA that could compete with the best. At Berlin, they would make it out of their group without dropping a map before they would fall to the eventual winners in Gambit Esports Gambit Esports Inactive Redgar Igor Vlasov Chronicle Timofey Khromov d3ffo Nikita Sudakov sheydos Bogdan Naumov nAts Ayaz Akhmetshin .In 2022, DRX acquired the Vision Strikers roster that would go on to become a mainstay in VCT.

Apart from one series loss to Incheon On Sla2ers Incheon On Sla2ers Korea Rank #16 Gravity wezzy VaNish froz XirZz , DRX rarely even lost a map against their domestic competition. At international events, their legacy would become that of dominating the group stage and then falling in the top six of playoffs, as they did at Masters Reykjavík and Masters Copenhagen . It seemed they were doomed to repeat this fate in Champions , when they were facing another top six elimination against FNATIC FNATIC Europe Rank #2 Boaster Jake Howlett Chronicle Timofey Khromov Alfajer Emir Ali Beder .

However, they had trouble integrating him into their system, and would not start at LOCK//IN . Instead, the original five from 2022 would earn a top four finish and continue their reign as the best team from Pacific. Foxy9 would debut in the regional league , where he would help DRX earn an 8-1 record. In playoffs, however, their Pacific dominance would come to an end when they were defeated by Paper Rex Paper Rex Asia-Pacific Rank #1 mindfreak Aaron Leonhart Jinggg Wang Jing Jie f0rsakeN Jason Susanto d4v41 Khalish Rusyaidee something Ilya Petrov . Foxy9 would make his international debut at Masters Tokyo , but when DRX lost to Evil Geniuses Evil Geniuses North America Rank #17 Derrek Derrek Ha NaturE Nicholas Garrison supamen Phat Le Apoth Vincent Le in the group stage, he was subbed out for Zest and would not play another game that year. With their roster troubles, DRX would fall in the first round of playoffs. In Champions , the original five members played their final tournament together, completing one last top six finish.In 2024, DRX released Rb and Zest, making Foxy9 and Flashback permanent additions of the starting roster. With this new roster however, DRX failed to qualify for Masters Madrid , their first time missing an international event since 2021. Shortly after their loss, Flashback had to temporarily step down from the roster, allowing BeYN to take his place. BeYN had been part of DRX Prospects DRX Prospects Korea Unranked Leviathan Na Ha-jun (나하준) for some time, but was finally getting a shot on the main roster. His addition revitalized the team, as they went a flawless 5-0 in stage one , but fell just short of making it to Masters Shanghai . Stage two saw yet another change, as another of their long-standing members, this time the IGL stax, was released , and Flashback returned to the active roster. This new combination of players would take DRX back to the international stage at Champions , where they would once again finish in the top six. DRX's resurgence maintains their Champions streak, as well as making MaKo and BuZz two of very few players to attend every Champions event.Foxy9 found his first win at Champions this year (Photo by Colin Young-Wolff/Riot Games).With these roster changes, MaKo remains the lone original member of DRX.

(Photo by Riot Games)The Asian region's Ascension competition was held in a ten-team, double-elimination bracket, with results from last year's tournament deciding the seeding for the teams. The teams qualified for Ascension Pacific were:The upper bracket of the ten-team tournament was dominated by two teams: Sin Prisa Gaming and FULL SENSE. Both teams, due to the format and seeding of the competition, were one of four teams that were required to play an extra match, while other teams received direct qualification into the quarterfinals.Both teams did not drop a map before meeting in the upper final. Sin Prisa Gaming defeated Revenant Esports, RIDDLE ORDER, and BOOM Esports, while FULL SENSE defeated Oblivion Force, Disguised, and Justice For Tomorrow.In the upper final, Sin Prisa claimed map one in dominant fashion, 13-6. While one may have expected them to carry their momentum into map two, the 13-0 blowout that ensued may have been hard to predict. The result came about on Haven, FULL SENSE's map pick that they had won on twice before in the competition.The win made for some eye-popping stat lines, including Ivy 's 411 ACS on Haven.The lower bracket had very few surprises. The team that had just been sent down from the upper bracket won in most cases, with RIDDLE ORDER being an exception.After being eliminated in the upper quarterfinals by Sin Prisa, they defeated NAOS and Justice For Tomorrow to reach the lower semifinals. There, they fell to eventual runners-up BOOM Esports.In the lower final, BOOM was matched up against FULL SENSE. Both teams had been defeated by Sin Prisa 2-0 previously, and a high-stakes rematch was on the line in the grand finals for the winner.BOOM would end up losing Lotus, but Shiro had himself a clip on it.After going up 2-0 with relatively few problems, a 14-12 overtime loss put BOOM, playing in front of a home crowd in Jakarta, in trouble of a reverse sweep. Any worries of that were negated on Sunset though, as they came out with a 3-1 victory to secure a rematch with Sin Prisa with a VCT berth on the line.A dominant showing on their opening pick and a good-enough performance on their opponents' map pick meant that Sin Prisa had a 2-0 lead heading into map three, with the chance to sweep yet another opponent in the tournament.It looked as though Boom had a path back into the match on Lotus. With a 9-6 lead, they had the chance to steal away Sin Prisa's second map pick, but a thrifty round seemed to change the tides for the Korean team.Sin Prisa claimed six straight rounds, but three straight from Boom forced overtime, where they won 14-12 to force a fourth map in the series.Map four, played on Haven, seemed to see the home favorites pushed with a new sense of motivation. They won three rounds to open the map, but Sin Prisa were back online following the run. Nine straight rounds from Sin Prisa gave them a comfortable halftime lead. The back-and-forth nature of the match continued, as BOOM tied up the map at 9-9 after beginning their attack side. They didn't look back, dropping just one round in the second half to force map five and bring the threat of a reverse sweep close to a reality.It felt as though Boom could do no wrong. They had the momentum and the crowd behind them on Bind, which they used to come out to an 11-6 lead. Despite the cushion of rounds, a Sin Prisa comeback forced overtime, and the Ascension grand final was settled 17-15 in favor of the Koreans.Francis was named the MVP of the competition. He finished the grand final with a 92/83/43 statline.

The Red Bull Home Ground #5 NA Play-Ins are soon to commence, with a total of four teams meeting in Seattle, Washington in hopes of claiming a ticket to the main event.Sentinels Sentinels North America Rank #2 N4RRATE Marshall Massey bang Sean Bezerra Zellsis Jordan Montemurro zekken Zachary Patrone johnqt Mohamed Amine Ouarid , Cloud9 Cloud9 North America Rank #4 Xeppaa Erick Bach Rossy Daniel Abedrabbo v1c Victor Truong moose Kaleb Jayne OXY Francis Hoang , and Moist x Shopify Moist x Shopify North America Rank #6 oderus Chad Miller all received direct invitations to the event, whereas YFP Gaming YFP Gaming North America Rank #12 jakee Jake Anderson bdog Brandon Sanders penny Erik Penny thief Brady Dever fiziq Lucas Blow were made to brawl their way through the NA Open Qualifier , taking down Ascension and Challengers representatives alike on their trudge to the top.Now, all four teams are on the verge of showcasing their talents with the help of stand-ins. At the time of writing, MxS have yet to announce their roster for the event, while Sentinels, Cloud9, and YFP have all been forced to utilize new troops .“I'm very happy and confident with the people I'm playing with.” stated Cloud9's Xeppaa when asked about his temporary teammates Mitch		" mitch "

Despite these inconveniences, Cloud9's veteran spoke highly of the two new pickups ahead of their match against MxS.“I'm also excited to play with v1c because I know what he brings. Playing with him for a bit and hearing from other people how he is as a teammate is exciting.” Another young talent who caught the eyes of many, v1c has made his way to Seattle to fight for the trophy, albeit not under MxS, the team he competed in Challengers under this past year.Xeppaa also spoke of another teammate from the past, Jake		" jakee "
		Anderson , who would be attending the LAN under a different jersey. “It's exciting to maybe play him and it's great to see him make it all the way here.” After taking a break from competing, jakee found himself taking on competition in NA Challengers earlier this year, but failed to make Ascension.Since then, the ex-C9 Controller had to pave his own way to Seattle alongside the rest of his team, a feat that Xeppaa acknowledged, but not without concerns. “I know they're not playing with stellar, one of the biggest reasons why they made it here considering [he] was their igl, so we'll have to see [how they do].”On the other end of the bracket, one enthusiastic Zellsis didn't let the recent retirement of Tyson		" TenZ "
		Ngo and Gustavo		" Sacy "
		Rossi stifle his motivation for another trophy. “I think [TenZ] just wants to take a break and live life a little bit with his wife, Kyedae , everything like that. Maybe we'll see him [again].”“Sacy has been competing for at least 10 years in eSports, way back even before Valorant, in League. He told me in Korea… he missed home, so I guess he also wanted to live life with his wife. Everyone's got a wife and are happy these days, I don't know.”“We scrimmed with curry and Reduxx last week and I think they slotted in very well. I don't know the rest of the Oxygen guys that personally, but with Reduxx he has shown a great upside in his attitude, skill, and overall potential. He's been frying in scrims, asking us what he can improve on… for his age and with his attitude I can see him having a very promising career.”Both Xeppaa and Zellsis felt confident in their new teammates who – albeit temporarily – would be playing alongside them at Seattle. The two both expressed excitement at a possible matchup, a match which would only be possible if Cloud9 and Sentinels won their openers against MxS and YFP.Who will come out on top?

2Game Esports 2Game Esports Brazil Rank #1 Zap Brenno Roberto pryze Luis-Henrique Viveiros lz Luiz Reche spike silentzz Caio Morita has won Americas Ascension and earned a spot in VCT Americas for the 2025 season. They defeated M80 M80 Inactive in the grand finals to become the fourth Brazilian representative in VCT.A Cinderella story is complete.Six teams across the Americas region qualified to compete for Ascension. These teams consisted of the top two from each of the North American, Brazilian, and Latin American subregions. Competing for Americas Ascension were:Going into the tournament, the North American teams, and especially M80, were considered heavy favorites. In the previous year , the two representatives from NA cruised past the South American competition and met each other in the grand finals. Things would not be quite so easy for them this year.While M80 would finish the group stage with a flawless 5-0 record, they were not met without challenge, with numerous map losses and overtime conversions needed to win. The other five teams were all evenly matched, with no clear hierarchy emerging among them. The second NA team, TSM, would disappoint, as they were eliminated in last place, only managing one win. Argentina's All Knights would come second, finding three wins, only losing to M80 and their regional rivals in Reta. The other three teams would all end with a 2-3 record, although tiebreakers would place Reta at fifth, eliminating them from playoff contention. This left both Brazilian teams to qualify for playoffs, with their top seeded Galorys even bouncing back from a 0-3 start to the tournament.Playoffs would start with a shocker, as the opening match saw Brazil's second seed 2Game Esports dominate the then undefeated M80 in 2-0 fashion. This game was followed by All Knights' win over Galorys, where in both maps, All Knights would find massive round streaks to win. This included winning ten rounds in a row to overcome a 4-12 deficit on Bind. 2Game would continue their momentum in the upper finals , where they defeated All Knights 2-1 to send them to the lower bracket to face M80, who had eliminated Galorys.The best-of-five lower finals started with All Knights domination, as they held M80 to a total of seven rounds across the first two maps. However, M80's zander would come alive in map three, putting up 31 kills to keep M80 alive. From there, the rest of M80 would wake up and roll over All Knights on the final two maps, successfully completing the reverse sweep, and earning a shot at redemption in the grand finals.The grand finals would also be a five map affair, but none of the maps were particularly close. 2Game would take Sunset and Haven, while M80 would win on Icebox and Abyss. However, 2Game's two map ban advantage meant that the final decider map would be Bind, a map M80 has only played one time in their history, that being against The Guard in the grand final of 2023's Ascension tournament. M80's inexperience showed, as 2Game would completely dismantle them, jumping out to a 10-2 score in the first half. M80 would find a couple rounds in the second half, but it wasn't long before 2Game secured their Ascension victory.This is now M80's second year in a row falling short in the grand finals of Ascension.Zap , put up a stellar performance in the grand finals, with a 1.34 rating across the series. As the IGL of the squad, he will lead his young and hungry teammates into new territory as they enter VCT.

XLG defeated CCG in a less-dominant sweep, setting up a rematch of the two qualified teams from Group A.After dropping a close map one, their first map loss of the tournament, and then easily taking map two, it took until overtime for Rare Atom to defeat XLG again, for the second time in the competition. XLG went on to play CCG again in the lower final, after they defeated ALG in the elimination match.The back-and-forth lower final went to a fifth map, but the final map was a 13-2 blowout going to XLG. It saw Rarga explode for 110 kills and achieve an ACS of 290. The 3-2 win set up for a third rematch in the grand final against Rare Atom.In the grand final, XLG came out ruthless, stealing away Rare Atom's first map pick and then winning their own map pick to go up 2-0, meaning a reverse sweep would be needed for their opponents. Despite their opponents having the double map ban, it appeared that XLG learned from the previous two meetings, and went on to win 3-0.Rare Atom has now made two consecutive Ascension China grand finals without victory.Rarga impressed in the grand final with a server-leading 57 kills, and was named the MVP of the competition. XLG will be the 12th team that participates in VCT China, and will hold membership for at least a year.
